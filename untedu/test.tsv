As our symbols represent not just Prolog atoms, but also handles to Java objects (including arbitrary size integers and decimals), everything is centered around a symbol garbage collection algorithm ensuring that external objects are shared and exchanged between logic engines efﬁciently. Taking advantage of a tag-on-data heap representation of Prolog terms, our algorithm performs in-place updates of live symbol references directly on heap cells. With appropriate ﬁne tuning of collection policies our algorithm provides a simple integrated memory management solution for Prolog systems, with amortized cost dominated by normally occurring heap garbage collection costs. Keywords: implementation of declarative languages, atom garbage collection, Prolog memory management, multi-engine Prolog, Prolog runtime system architecture. Introduction 1. Symbol garbage collection is particularly important in prac- tical applications of declarative languages that rely on inter- nalized symbols as their main building blocks. In the case of Prolog, applications as diverse as natural language tools, XML processors, database interfaces and compilers rely on dynamic symbols (atoms in Prolog parlance) to represent everything from tokens and graph vertices to predicate and function names. A task as simple as scanning for a single Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for proﬁt or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the ﬁrst page.

PPDP’2010 Copyright c(cid:13) 2010 ACM . . . $10.00 Prolog clause in a large data ﬁle can break a Prolog system not enabled with symbol garbage collection. The use in the implementation language of packages pro- viding arbitrary length integers and decimals to support such data types in Prolog brings in similar memory management challenges. While it is common practice in Prolog imple- mentations to represent ﬁxed size numerical data directly on the heap (given the beneﬁts of quick memory reclamation on backtracking), conversion from arbitrary size integers or decimals to serialized heap representations tends to be costly and can add complexity to the implementation1. Such problems can become particularly severe in multi- engine Prolog (deﬁned here roughly as any Prolog system with multiple heap/stack/trail data areas) where design deci- sions on symbol memory management are unavoidably con- nected to decisions on symbol sharing mechanisms and en- gine life-cycle management. It is also important in this sce- nario to support sharing of data objects among engines and avoid copying between heaps as well as serialization/deseri- alization costs of potentially large objects. Often, reference counting mechanisms have been used for symbol garbage collection. A major problem is that if the symbol table is used for non-atomic objects like handles to logic engines or complex Java objects that may also refer to other such handles, cycles formed by dead objects may go undetected. Another problem is that reference counting involves extensive changes to existing code - as every single use of a given variable in a built-in needs to be made aware of it. These considerations suggest the need for an integrated solution to symbol and engine garbage collection as well as exchange of arbitrary Prolog terms between multiple en- gines. This paper describes the implementation of such a solu- tion in our ongoing Lean Prolog implementation that pro- vides sharing among engines of arbitrary size external data, 1 While serialization can be avoided in C-based systems using pointers to “blobs” on the heap and type castings, this is not an option in strongly typed Java.****************************************************************************************************	NA

Identifying functionally important sites from biological sequences, formulated as a biological sequence labeling problem, has broad applications ranging from rational drug design to the analysis of metabolic and signal transduction networks. In this paper, we present an approach to biolog- ical sequence labeling that takes into account the global similarity between biological sequences. Our approach combines unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. Given a set of sequences and a similarity measure deﬁned on pairs of sequences, we learn a mixture of experts model by using spectral clustering to learn the hierarchical struc- ture of the model and by using bayesian approaches to com- bine the predictions of the experts. We evaluate our ap- proach on two important biological sequence labeling prob- lems: RNA-protein and DNA-protein interface prediction problems. The results of our experiments show that global sequence similarity can be exploited to improve the per- formance of classiﬁers trained to label biological sequence data. 1. Introduction Machine learning methods currently offer one of the most cost-effective approaches to construction of predictive models in applications where representative training data are available. The supervised learning problem [10] can be formally deﬁned as follows: Given an independent and identically distributed (iid) dataset of labeled instances D Rd and yi ∈ Y , where Y is the set of ,n, xi ∈ (xi, yi)i=1, all possible class labels, a hypothesis class H representing the set of all possible hypotheses that can be learned, and a performance criterion P , the learning algorithm L outputs a H (i.e., a classiﬁer) that optimizes P . Dur- hypothesis h ing classiﬁcation, the task of the classiﬁer h is to accurately assign a new instance xtest to a class label y Y . ∈ ··· Most biological data involve sequence data, e.g., nucleic or amino acid sequences. Biological sequence labeling is an example of supervised learning problem. The labeled in- stances (xi, yi)i=1, ,n, are pairs of input/output sequences, yi,m), where xi = (xi,1xi,2 · · · yi,j in the output sequence is the class label for xi,j in the , m. Given a input (or observation) sequence, j = 1, new input sequence xtest, the task of the classiﬁer h H is to predict a class label for each element that appears at each position along the sequence. xi,m) and yi = (yi,1yi,2 · · · · · · ∈ ··· ∈ Advances in high throughput data acquisition technolo- gies have resulted in rapid increase in the amount of data in biological sciences. For example, progress on sequenc- ing technologies has resulted in the release of hundreds of complete genome sequences. With the exponentially grow- ing number of biological sequences from genome projects and high-throughput experimental studies, sequence anno- tations do not keep pace with sequencing. The wet-lab ex- periments to determine the annotations (e.g., functional site annotations) are still difﬁcult and time consuming. Hence, there is an urgent need for development of computational A large volume of work has been carried out to label biological sequence data. Terribilini et al. [18] trained Naive Bayes classiﬁers to identify RNA-protein interface residues in a protein sequence. Qian and Sejnowski [16] trained Neural Networks to predict protein secondary struc- ture, i.e., classifying each residue in a protein sequence into one of the three classes: helix (H), strand (E) or coil (C). Caragea et al. [5] and Kim et al. [12] used Support Vec- tor Machines to identify residues in a protein sequence that undergo post-translational modiﬁcations.

Collins, Jr.* University of Houston pmcollins@uh.edu Virtually all quantitative research on the U.S. Supreme Court utilizes one or more of the Spaeth Supreme Court judicial databases. To promote their intelligent use, Sara Benesh (2005) provides a superb treatment of the management of these datasets. Explicit in her discussion is the need for common standards in the selection of, for example, units of analyses to promote the comparability and reliability of Supreme Court research. The purpose of this article is to contribute to this discourse by providing an easily implemented code that allows users to reliably transform the unit of analysis in ALLCOURT, the Original U.S. Supreme Court Judicial Database, which runs from 1953 to the end of the Court’s last completed term.1 The structure of ALLCOURT is set up such that the case is the unit of analysis, which makes certain types of research questions more easily broached than others. Seven years ago, Sara Benesh and Chris Zorn (1998) performed a great service to the law and courts community by publishing code that allows users of the database to alter its unit of analysis from the case to the justice-vote. Currently, three flipped datasets, based on the Benesh and Zorn code, are available on the Ulmer Project’s website, containing information on the Warren (1953-1969), Burger (1969-1985), and Rehnquist (1986-1998) Courts, respectively.2 While the availability of these datasets allows researchers to tackle new questions, analyzing judicial behavior based on these Justice-centered databases is limited in two regards. First, because the justice-centered databases are separate files, researchers are required to merge these datasets in order to correspond to roughly the time frame of ALLCOURT. Second, the Justice-Centered Rehnquist database is only current to the 1998 term and, as such, does not include information from the 1999-2004 terms. To alleviate these problems, I offer new code for Stata3 that allows researchers to transform the unit of analysis in ALLCOURT from the case to the justice-vote. In addition to allowing researchers to transform all of ALLCOURT, this new code, based on updates made to Stata since 1998, substantially expedites and simplifies the data transformation process. Graphically, the code transforms ALLCOURT from this format: c a se 1 2 re h n d ir 0 1 s te v d ir 0 1 o c o n d ir 0 1 s c a ldir 0 1 k e n d ir 1 0 s o u td ir 1 0 th o m d ir 1 0 g in d ir 1 0 b ry d ir 1 0 To this format: ju s tic e re h n s t e v o c o n s c a l k e n s o u t th o m g in b ry re h n s t e v o c o n s c a l k e n s o u t th o m g in b ry c a s e 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 d i r 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 WINTER 2006 22****************************************************************************************************	Spring 2005

Finding the exact materials that I feel will best meet the course competencies and prepare my students for their TExES exams in the principal (EDAD 5680) and superintendent (EDAD 6100) categories in a blended course format has proven to be extremely time consuming. The task has also proven to be most rewarding and actually quite fun. If you developed a course as part of your project, when is it scheduled to be offered? I have developed blended course syllabi for EDAD 6100 and EDAD 5680 for Fall semester 2010 that includes the use of pre-prepared webinars, websites, videos, etc. I tested earlier drafts of these syllabi with my classes in Spring 2010, as well as EDAD 5630 in Fall 2009. I have met with CLEAR for help in designing EDAD 6100 and EDAD 5680 in the blended format. CLEAR has designed banners for each class and moved templates for each to Fall 2010 on Blackboard. What, if anything, remains to be completed for your project and what is the schedule for project completion? I am in the process of completing my uploads to Blackboard for complete class set-up. I am also scheduling another appointment with CLEAR to be sure that I understand how to use Blackboard in the best possible way to help me most effectively facilitate these classes. Please provide information on any funds that were spent from the project budget since the last report (amount and purpose). Please also list any purchases that remain to be made with grant funds.

In this paper, we introduce harmonic Maass–Jacobi forms, which include the classical Jacobi forms as well as Zwegers’ functions as examples. Maass–Jacobi–Poincaré series also provide prime examples. We compute their Fourier expan- sions, which yield Zagier-type dualities and also yield a lift to skew-holomorphic Jacobi–Poincaré series. Finally, we link harmonic Maass–Jacobi forms to different kinds of automorphic forms via a commutative diagram. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SHEPLER AND SARAH WITHERSPOON Abstract. Hochschild cohomology governs deformations of algebras, and its graded Lie structure plays a vital role. We study this structure for the Hochschild cohomology of the skew group algebra formed by a ﬁnite group acting on an al- gebra by automorphisms. We examine the Gerstenhaber bracket with a view toward deformations and developing bracket formulas. We then focus on the linear group actions and polynomial algebras that arise in orbifold theory and representation theory; deformations in this context include graded Hecke alge- bras and symplectic reﬂection algebras. We give some general results describing when brackets are zero for polynomial skew group algebras, which allow us in particular to ﬁnd noncommutative Poisson structures. For abelian groups, we express the bracket using inner products of group characters. Lastly, we inter- pret results for graded Hecke algebras. 1. Introduction Let G be a ﬁnite group acting on a C-algebra S by automorphisms. Defor- mations of the natural semi-direct product S#G, the skew group algebra, include many compelling and inﬂuential algebras. For example, when G acts linearly on a ﬁnite dimensional, complex vector space V , it induces an action on the symmetric algebra S(V ) (a polynomial ring). Deformations of S(V )#G play a profound role in representation theory and connect diverse areas of mathematics. Graded Hecke algebras were originally deﬁned independently by Drinfeld [6] and (in the special case of Weyl groups) by Lusztig [15]. These deformations of S(V )#G include sym- plectic reﬂection algebras (investigated by Etingof and Ginzburg [7] in the study of orbifolds) and rational Cherednik algebras (introduced by Cherednik [5] to solve Date: November 19, 2010. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation. 16E40, 16S80.

With the establishment of de facto standard “Best Practice” reference and process models such as the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) or Control Objectives for IT and related Technologies (CobiT), an integrated management architecture for the provision of IT-Services built upon standards- based processes and tools becomes feasible. ITIL provides a structured and widely adopted approach to IT Service Management and its processes. ITIL can further be aligned with related standards such as ISO 20000 to manifest IT Service Management practice or CobiT to support IT Governance. However IT Management processes must be developed to align with the existing IT infrastructure and operation and must be modeled around frameworks such as ITIL. This paper illustrates the key IT Management requirements and reviews the current state of the art. A case study highlights the contribution of reference models and management related tools for organizations and presents an integrated management architecture. Keywords— IT Management, IT Service Management, ITIL. I. INTRODUCTION “An IT service [according to ITILv3] is a service provided to one or more customers by an IT service provider. An IT service is based on the use of IT and supports the customer‘s business processes. An IT service is made up from a combination of people, processes and technology and should be defined in a Service Level Agreement.“ (Iqbal et al, 2007) I T Services have existed ever since the adoption of IT Systems. However there has been rather limited progress in the standardization of processes for the delivery of IT Services (Chesbrough and Spohrer, 2006;). However, giving the rising costs of IT and the importance of IT in today’s corporations the need the alignment or correspondence between the business goals and the IT requirements), IT Compliance (e.g. Sarbanes Oxley) or the management of IT Services becomes evident (Johannsen & Goeken, 2006; Masak, 2006).

Wisdom Oklahoma State University Jennifer L. Callahan University of North Texas Abstract in classification of It is paradoxical that individuals with mental retardation are disproportionately represented the criminal justice system, suggesting a greater proportion of false positives, while at the same time there is concern regarding a potential motivation for individuals without mental retardation to simulate such a condition for the purpose of avoiding the death penalty, a concern for false negatives. To determine if the likelihood of accurate impairment could be enhanced, we examined the pattern of scaled scores in the WAIS-III standardization dataset. Specifically, we compared the scores obtained by individuals obtaining a Full Scale IQ within the Borderline range with those in the Mild or Moderate range of impairment. Difference scores among the indexes were used to create a composite indicator making it possible to more than double the likelihood of correctly detecting impairment. Given the potential motivation to simulate impairment, a unique feature of the composite indicator described here is the inclusion of a regression equation to estimate missing values. in with retardation The American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD; formerly American Association on Mental Retardation; AAMR) reports that individuals are mental disproportionately represented in the United States criminal justice system, with estimates ranging from 4% to 10% in comparison to estimates of mental retardation the general ranging between 1.5% and 2.5% population (AAMR, 2002). Such individuals pose unique considerations within the criminal justice system. For example, an individual with mental retardation may have a heightened desire to appease authority figures, have poor comprehension of causality, be easily led, and/or display an exaggerated willingness to talk (Brodsky & Bennett, 2005). Illustrating these vulnerabilities, a study reported by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, 2004) examining a defendant’s ability to comprehend their Miranda rights found that 73% of individuals with intellectual impairment did not truly understand that their statements could be used against them in legal proceedings. It is not surprising then that in a study of 125 cases where individuals were later exonerated, Drizin and Leo (2004) found that 22% of the falsely retardation implications of mental individuals had mental retardation. Such convicted alarming figures merit researchers’ attention to the how the needs of individuals that are intellectually impaired may be better identified and served in the criminal justice system. The are particularly salient in potential death penalty cases. Between 1976 and 1995 there were 18 people with documented mental disabilities, including mental retardation, executed for capital crimes in the United States. Of 30 executions in 1995, 20% of the individuals put to death had mental retardation, despite the U.S. Supreme Court having previously expressed the opinion that mental retardation poses a mitigating circumstance (e.g., Penry v. Lynaugh; 492, U.S. 302, 1989) that must be considered. Further, in 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court opined more strongly, in Atkins v. Virginia (536, U.S. 304, 2002), that execution of an individual with mental retardation violates the Eighth Amendment. As a result, 26 of the 40 death penalty states have enacted legislation protecting individuals with mental retardation from execution. The definitions of mental retardation described in state and federal statutes typically draw upon those provided by professional organizations such as the AAIDD and/or the American Psychiatric Association (APA), but important differences between professional guidelines and statutes exist. Generally, legislation describes mental retardation as characterized by persisting deficits in both intellectual and adaptive functioning (e.g., social, conceptual, and practical skills in everyday life) with onset beginning prior adulthood (see, for example, Oklahoma Statutes §10-1408, 2005). Intellectual deficit is typically defined as obtaining a full scale IQ that is two or more standard deviations below the mean on a standardized intelligence test, such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), and may be specifically set at 70 or below (again, see for example, Oklahoma Statutes §10-1408, 2005). Unfortunately, such legislative from AAMR and APA definitions often deviate guidelines, which provide a more ambiguous cut score for considering full scale IQ to be consistent with mental retardation.

In Phase 1, I examined existing general learning objectives (GLOs) for the course for their specification and appropriateness. Only minor adjustments were found to be necessary. Changes resulting from this reassessment were incorporated in the student learning objectives (SLOs) for each of the eight modules of the course. The changes were operationalized through changes to discussion questions, since the discussion questions were designed to address the SLOs. This was completed for all modules of the course prior to commencement of the Spring, 2012 semester. Phase 2 is currently in progress. The original plan was to incorporate wikis in the second half of the semester only. Because, I did more than what was planned in Phase-1 (i.e., I updated ALL modules), I decided to launch the wiki at the beginning of the semester. In addition, learning theory (the COI framework) and my empirical findings (my research with the undergraduate wiki) suggest that the instructor’s involvement (teaching presence) plays a critical role in the level of cooperation and exchange of ideas (social presence) and cognitive enhancements for the student (cognitive presence). To test this phenomenon in at the graduate level, I adopted a temporal sequencing process for the instructor’s involvement in the wiki. More specifically, in the first half of the semester, I have left the students, entirely to themselves to learn, adapt to and use the wiki to complete the first of two team projects in the class. The class is currently in this phase of the experiment. When the second project begins after Spring Break, I will take a more active role on the wiki. From a research-design perspective, this approach allows me to the “before and after” evidence to assess the impact of instructor involvement on social and cognitive presence in the wiki environment. Project Accomplishments to Date: The project was envisioned to be completed in three phases 1. Phase 1- Developing the Implementation Plan, 2. Phase 2 - Pilot Testing the Wiki-enhanced Learning Modules, and 3. Phase 3 - Fine Tuning the Wiki-enhanced Teaching Pedagogy: I have completed Phase-1 and I am on-track to complete Phase-2 of the project, on schedule, at the end of the spring, 2012 semester.****************************************************************************************************	Microsoft Word - LEG Reporting Form_mar16 DED.doc

If X is a compact metric space of dimension n, then K(X), the n- dimensional kernel of X, is the union of all n-dimensional Cantor manifolds in X. Alek- sandrov raised the problem of what the descriptive complexity of K(X) could be. A straightforward analysis shows that if X is an n-dimensional complete separable metric space, then K(X) is a i} or PCA set. We show (a) there is an n-dimensional continuum X in R"*! for which K(X)-is a complete I} set. In particular, K(X) € IZ} - T}; K(X) is coanalytic but is not an analytic set and (b) there is an n-dimensional continuum X in R°+? for which K(X) is a complete 5 set. In particular, K(X) € U4 — I}; K(X) is PCA, but not CPCA. It is also shown the Lebesgue measure as a function on the closed subsets of [0, 1] is an explicit, example of an upper semicontinuous function which is not countably continuous. I. Complexity of K(X). Let us recall that an n-dimensional Cantor manifold is a compact n-dimensional space which cannot be separated by a closed subset of dimension < n —2. Since there are complete separable metric spaces of dimension n which contain no compact sets of dimension n, there are n-dimensional spaces which contain no Cantor manifolds of dimension n. However, every compact metric space of dimension n does contain an n-dimensional Cantor manifold. If X is a compact metric space of dimension n, then K(X), the n-dimensional kernel of X, is the union of all n-dimensional Cantor manifolds in_X. R. Pol [P], in answering a question of Aleksandrov [A], has given an example of a space X such that X \ K(X) is still n-dimensional. As Pol pointed out to us, Aleksandrov also raised the question of what the descriptive complexity of K(X) could be. For Pol’s example, it turns out that K(X) is a Borel set. We will determine the exact bounds on the complexity of K(X) in this paper. We first note the following 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification: Primary 54B05, 04405; Secondary 28A05.

As the son of immigrants (of Italian-Sicilian and Greek- Arab descent), Zappa developed a sense of being an outsider at an early age. Due to Zappa’s chronic health problems, the family moved to a warmer lo- cale, eventually ending up in California. The family continued to relocate throughout the state, moving from Monterey to the San Gabriel Valley, El Cajon, San Diego, and Lancaster in the Mojave Desert northeast of Los Angeles. These constant reloca- tions reinforced Zappa’s outsider status, and he found himself associating primarily with other marginalized members of society—namely, the Af- rican American and Hispanic families who repre- sented the fringe elements of the Lancaster commu- nity at that time. Following graduation from high school, Zappa attended Chaffey Junior College but dropped out after one semester. This experience no doubt con- tributed to his lifelong disdain for formal educa- tion. After a stint producing and composing for a number of low-budget films (which ended abruptly when he was arrested on a trumped- up pornography charge—exacerbating his cynical view of the government), Zappa joined the band the Soul Giants, which under his leadership became 1661 ****************************************************************************************************

Box 310920 Denton, Texas 76201, USA Parque Etnobotánico Omora, Universidad de Magallanes, Instituto de Ecología y Biodiversidad, Puerto Williams, Chile; e-mail: rozzi@unt.edu “Una ética para complementar y guiar la relación económica con la tierra presupone la existencia de alguna imagen mental de la tierra concebida como un mecanismo biótico” (Leopold 1949) INTRODUCCIÓN los Las ciencias ecológicas y evolutivas proveen una “imagen mental” que ofrece un espectro de relaciones entre la sociedad y el mundo natural más amplio que el considerado por la economía y la ética clásica. Las ciencias evolutivas afirman que los seres humanos compartimos un las demás especies origen común con biológicas. Las ciencias ecológicas reconocen que seres humanos establecemos interacciones con una multitud de especies biológicas y procesos ecosistémicos, y más recientemente enfatizan que el bienestar de las comunidades humanas y el de las comunidades bióticas son complementarios (Rozzi 2001, Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Basado en esta “imagen mental” derivada de las ciencias ecológicas y evolutivas, Aldo Leopold propone un nuevo tipo de relación entre la límites de naturaleza, extendiendo consideración ética hacia “los suelos, las aguas, las plantas, los animales o colectivamente: la tierra”. Esta comprensión ecológica condujo a Leopold a proponer un giro ético que “cambia el papel del Homo sapiens: de conquistador de la comunidad de la tierra al de simple miembro y ciudadano de ella”. la sociedad contemporánea y los Este giro ético cobra especial relevancia a comienzos del siglo XXI puesto que aborda las causas últimas de la crisis ambiental actual: el modo de relación establecido por la sociedad industrial globalizada con el mundo natural. Aldo Leopold (1887-1948), graduado de la escuela de Ingeniería Forestal de Yale en 1909, trabajó por veinte años en el Servicio Forestal de Estados Unidos para luego incorporarse como profesor de manejo de vida silvestre en la Universidad de Wisconsin. Durante su trayectoria comprendió la necesidad de incorporar criterios ecológicos en las prácticas y políticas de manejo, visión que comunica de manera poética en su obra más conocida: “A sand county almanac”, que culmina con el ensayo “La ética de la tierra”. Leopold no reacciona con una simple protesta, sino que ofrece una visión que incorpora la relación económica en un contexto más amplio, el ecológico. La incorporación de esta visión en la educación, la toma de decisiones y las políticas de desarrollo ofrece una alternativa ecológicamente informada para superar algunos de los problemas ambientales más apremiantes (Callicott 1999). Por esta razón, La ética de la tierra constituye un documento cada vez más citado en artículos y libros de ecología y conservación biológica (Leopold 2004). Su publicación en español en la Revista Chilena de Historia Natural contribuirá significativamente al desafío de integrar la ética ambiental dentro la práctica científica y enseñanza de la ecología en Latinoamérica. La comprensión aportada por el texto de Leopold y la filosofía ambiental favorecería en América Latina una reconexión no solo con la diversidad de seres vivos, sino también con la diversidad de pueblos amerindios y sus saberes puesto que, tal como las ciencias ecológicas, estos expresan una****************************************************************************************************	12-RChHN 80-4-Rozzi

After using ARIMA modeling with intervention analysis to measure unexpected volume, the author builds a categorical regression model to explain the cross-sectional relationship between a three-day cumulative abnormal prediction error, unexpected volume, conditions in the market at time of issue (hot markets), and the market in which the issue trades. Analysis reveals that unexpected volume is significantly positively correlated with abnormal return, consistent with the price-pressure hypothesis.

ALTHOUGH there ha ve been, even from the most remote times, indi Yidua ls who have dedicated them selves exclusively to the cure of dental maladies, or to repairing th e lo sses of the dental system by artificial means, and notwithstanding the progress gradually acco mplished in this branch of the medical an, which progress was especially remarkable during th e sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it is not to be denied that, up to the beginning of the eighteenth century, dentistry was, in great part, It is but natural considered one wit h medicine and surgery in general. that dental art (and the sa me may be said of every special branch of medicine) could not assume a real individuality until it had attained to the higher grades of its development. As a matter of fact, dentistry, toward the end of the seventeenth century, was already a true specialty, although it counted but few worthy representatives at that time . The definite separation between the science and art of dentistry and general medicine and surgery, although it may have been retarded, could not fail to take place; and this, as we shall presently see, was effected by the celebrated French dentist Pierre Fauchard. But, to remain faithful to chronological order, we will f.irst speak briefly of so me other writers. LuDWIG CRoN, a barber of Leipsic, in a pamphlet published in I7I7, with the title Th e barber's apprentice versed in bleeding and tooth pulling, 1 declares, in a still more emphatic and general way than De Lavauguyon, that it is useless to detach the gum before proceeding to extract a tooth. This barber, strong in his own experience, dares to assert absolutely use less this ancient practice, advised first by Cornelius Celsus, and recom mended after him, and in homage to his authority, by many other writers. It is, therefore, possible that even previous to Cron and De Lavauguyon many operators had dispensed with the practice recommended by Celsus, although this had become an accepted canon of the high medical pro fession.

We investigate deformations of a skew group algebra that arise from a ﬁnite group acting on a polynomial ring. When the characteristic of the underlying ﬁeld divides the order of the group, a new type of deformation emerges that does not occur in characteristic zero. This analogue of Lusztig’s graded aﬃne Hecke algebra for positive characteristic can not be forged from the template of symplectic reﬂection and related algebras as originally crafted by Drinfeld. By contrast, we show that in characteristic zero, for arbitrary ﬁnite groups, a Lusztig-type deformation is always isomorphic to a Drinfeld- type deformation. We ﬁt all these deformations into a general theory, connecting Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt deformations and Hochschild cohomology when working over ﬁelds of arbitrary characteristic. We make this connection by way of a double complex adapted from Guccione, Guccione, and Valqui, formed from the Koszul resolution of a polynomial ring and the bar resolution of a group algebra. 1. Introduction Deformations of skew group algebras in positive characteristic provide a rich theory that diﬀers substantially from the characteristic zero setting, as we argue in this article. Such deformations over ﬁelds of characteristic zero are classical. Lusztig used a graded version of the aﬃne Hecke algebra over the complex numbers to investigate the representation theory of groups of Lie type. His graded aﬃne Hecke algebra is a deformation of the natural semi-direct product algebra, i.e., skew group algebra, arising from a Coxeter group acting on a polynomial ring. Lusztig [19] described the algebra in terms of generators and relations that deform the action of the group but preserve the polynomial ring. Around the same time, Drinfeld [8] gave a deformation of the same skew group algebra, for arbitrary ﬁnite Date: June 12, 2014.

Adding nondeterminism to SC leaves it in the domain of parallel computation since NSC E POLYLOGSPACE. That is, NSC is a subset of the class of languages computable by fast parallel computers. Adding noodeter- minism to NC appears to make it much more powerful since NNC = NP. It is clear that NSCE NNC, and probable that NSC C NNC. We provide further evidence for this conjeeture by showing that NSC is precisely the class of languages recognizable in simultaneous polynomial time and polylog reversals by a nondeterministic Turing machine with a read-only input tape and a single read-write work-tape.

INTRODUCTION The complexity classes NC and SC have been well studied in the recent literature. NC is the class of languages which can be accepted by small, fast parallel computers. NC remains the same class under many definitions of a “parallel computer” (see, for example, Dymond [41, Dymond and Cook 151, and Ruzzo [20]). Pippenger [191 has demonstrated that NC is the class of languages which can be recognized by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time and polylog reversals (a reversal is said to occur when any tape head changes direction). SC is the class of languages which can be recognized by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time and polylog work-space (that is, not counting the space needed for the storage of the inputs). It is widely conjectured that SC # NC. More strongly, it is expected that NC !Z SC and SC !Z NC (see, for example, Cook [3]). We will consider the impact of nondeterminism on small, fast parallel computers. The effect of nondeterminism on sequential computers is well studied in the form of the P # NP problem [2], [13]. P is the class of languages recognized by fast sequential computers. P remains the same class under many definitions of “computer.” NP is the nondeterministic analogue of P. While the P # NP question is still open, a large amount of evidence in favor of the conjecture has been accumulated. There exist a large number of problems which have been shown to be NP-complete; that is, they are members of NP and have the property that if any one of them are members of P, then P = NP. Garey and Johnson [6] have gathered a large list of NP-complete problems. Nondeterministic analogues of the classes NC and SC, called NNC and NSC, respectively, can be defined in a natural manner using a standard nondeterministic Turing machine model with k one-way infinite work-tapes and a single read-only input tape (after the manner of Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [l]). A nondeterministic Turing machine runs in time T(n) and space S ( n ) if for all accepted inputs of size n there is an accepting computation which uses time at most T(n) and space at most S ( n ) . A nondeterministic Turing machine runs in time T ( n ) and reversals R ( n ) if for all accepted inputs of size n there is an accepting computation which uses time at most T ( n ) and reversals at most R ( n ) . The reversals and space are measured on the work-tapes only. We assume that the running time T(n) = Q(n) and the space bound S ( n ) = n(log n). For definiteness, we define NC to be the class of languages recognizable in polynomial time and polylog reversals on a k-tape deterministic Turing machine, NNC to be the class of languages recognizable in polynomial time and polylog Manuscript received September 10, 1986; revised October 29, 1987.

The proof of Pippenger that NC is exactly the class of languages recognizable in polynomial size and polylog depth by uniform circuits [19] extends easily to our Turing machine model. The simulation of a uniform circuit by a Turing machine is straightforward since our Turing machine is a more general form of that used by Pippenger in that we do not count reversals on the input tape. Pippenger does not count the number of tapes required; two work-tapes are sufficient. Dymond [4] notes that three tapes are sufficient, but he does not distinguish between the input tape and the work-tapes. The simulation of our Turing machine by a uniform circuit appears in Parberry [ 151, [ 161. An improved simulation with tighter resource bounds appears in Parberry [17], [18]. Suppose we define a nondeterministic uniform circuit to be a uniform circuit augmented with a polynomial number of auxiliary inputs. Such a circuit accepts its input if there is an assignment to the auxiliary inputs that results in the output having value 1. It is easy to show that NNC is exactly the class of languages recognizable in polynomial size, polylog depth, by a nondeterministic uniform circuit family. Let POLYLOGSPACE denote the class of languages recognizable in polylog space on a Turing machine. By Savitch’s theorem [2 11, the Turing machine may be either deterministic or nondeterministic. POLYLOGSPACE is widely accepted to be the class of languages recognizable by fast parallel computers. Goldschlager [7], [9] has called this characterization the parallel computation thesis. NC is widely accepted to be the class of languages recognizable by small, fast parallel computers. Dymond [4], [5] has called this characteriza- tion the extendedparallel computation thesis. By Savitch’s theorem 1211, NSC C POLYLOGSPACE; that is, languages in NSC can be recognized by fast parallel computers. II. THE RESULTS Although it is popularly conjectured that SC !Z NC, the opposite is true for the corresponding nondeterministic complexity classes. To see that NSC E NNC, note that NSC E NP and: Theorem I : NNC = NP. Proof: Clearly NNC E NP. To see that NP C NNC, first observe that every language in P has a polynomial-size uniform circuit. This fact was first noted by Ladner [14]. (A more detailed proof appears in Parberry [18].) We will first demonstrate that P C NNC. Suppose L E P. From the above observation, there exists a polynomial-size uniform circuit CL which recognizes L. A polyno- mial-size, logarithmic-depth nondeterministic uniform circuit for L can be constructed as follows. The nondeterministic circuit guesses a value for every wire in CL and verifies that the guessed values are consistent and that the output is 1 . The verification can be carried out by using a single layer of gates which corresponds exactly to the gates in C,, and a tree of AND gates of depth O(1og n). This shows that P E NNC. A similar argument shows that NP E NNC. If L E NP, then L can be recognized in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine augmented with a “random” tape provided we define acceptance of the input to mean that there exists a sequence of symbols which, when written on the random tape, causes the machine to deterministically enter the accept state on the given input. This is essentially the “guess-verify” Turing machine model of Garey and Johnson [6]. A polynomial-size nondeterministic uniform circuit can be constructed from this Turing machine by applying the technique of Ladner to the deterministic portion of the computation. This can be simulated by a polynomial-size, logarithmic-depth nondeterministic uniform circuit as before. 0 In light of Theorem 1, it appears extremely likely that adding nondeterminism to small, fast parallel computers increases their power. Since NC C P, if NNC = NC then NP = P = NC.

With focus on its diﬀerences with conventional WAM implementations, we explain key details of BinProlog’s compilation technique, which replaces the WAM with a simpliﬁed continuation passing runtime system (the “BinWAM”), based on a mapping of full Prolog to binary logic programs. This is followed by a description of a term compression technique using a “tag-on-data” representation. Later derivatives, the Java-based Jinni Prolog compiler and the recently developed Lean Prolog system reﬁne the BinProlog architecture with ﬁrst-class Logic Engines, made generic through the use of an Interactor interface.

The purpose of the UNT 2012 Faculty Climate Survey was to gather faculty perceptions on issues that impact institutional climate and overall job satisfaction, including recruitment and hiring, teaching, research, service, merit and promotion evaluations, workload issues, balance of work and personal life, mentoring, resources, diversity, overall satisfaction, general climate. Provost Warren Burggren appointed a task force representing all colleges and schools, to develop and administer the survey with Vice Provost for Faculty Success Christy Crutsinger as the chair. Members of the committee included: • Mickey Abel, College of Visual Arts & Design • Tracy Everbach, Mayborn School of Journalism • Francisco Guzman, College of Business • Warren Henry, College of Music • Kuruvilla John, College of Engineering • Linda Marshall, College of Arts & Sciences • Mariela Nunez Janes, College of Public Affairs and Community Service • Sanjukta Pookulangara, College of Merchandising, Hospitality, and Tourism • Mike Sayler, College of Education • Mark Vosvick, Faculty Senate • Jerry Wircenski, College of Information Methodology The Survey Research Institute at Cornell University was contracted to administer the online survey of full- time tenured, tenure-track and non-tenure track faculty. Participants in the survey were contacted via email on November 8, 2012 with three follow-up email reminders to non-respondents. To increase response rate, an incentive was offered by the Office of the Provost. Ten faculty members were randomly selected from representative departments that achieved an 80% response rate to receive $250 for faculty travel or other professional development. Data collection ended on January 25, 2013. In total, 700 participants completed the survey out of a possible 1062 faculty members, yielding a completion rate of 65.9%. Additionally, 60 participants answered at least one question, yielding an overall response rate of 71.9% Key Findings Table 1 contains the demographic profile of respondents compared to the population of all faculty at UNT. Females were more likely to respond to the survey than males. Asian and other ethnic groups were less likely to respond to the survey as compared to whites. Statistically significant differences were tested for the 212 questions, with 29% showing differences by gender, 53.2% differences by ethnicity (white, Asians, African Americans, Latino/as and other), and 77.4% differences by rank (assistant, associate, full and lecturers). Key findings from each category are listed below. Recruitment and Hiring Most faculty members are satisfied or very satisfied with the overall hiring process including the quality of information about responsibilities associated with the position and their colleague’s efforts to meet and recruit them to UNT. Faculty members are less satisfied with their initial salary, start-up package and the negotiation process.

Therefore, it is important to use a reliable instrument to measure information service quality. SERVQUAL is a popular instrument for doing this, but, though widely used, it has been criticized for its reliability and validity. Use of the performance measures from SERVQUAL to form SERVPERF has addressed some of these issues. However, Magal’s instrument on information center success was found effective within a service context because of its service orientation. In our study, we therefore compared Magal’s instrument with the SERVPERF instrument in predicting satisfaction and usefulness; we found that Magal’s instrument had predictive advantages in determining future usefulness and satisfaction. An important result was to show that our results supported the use of Magal’s instrument as an alternative to SERVQUAL for researchers and managers interested in service quality assessment. # 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Polymer liquid crystal (PLC) molecules have a fraction 8 of thermotropic sequences, with the remainder 1 - 8 fully flexible. The excess Gibbs function of mixing for the ternary system is formulated, and chemical potentials of the components in the anisotropic phase are derived; a set of five equations defines the anisotropic-isotropic phase equilibrium. Calculated miscibility gaps have the usual base on the PLC + flexible polymer side, but unusual shapes (cusps) are predicted for values of the characteristic temperature of the mixture !P in certain intervals; such shapes appear for fully rigid rods as well as for 8 < 1. Moving from the Gibbs triangle base toward the top (solvent), we find the LC order parameter s quite high, except in the immediate vicinity of pure solvent. As an example, s = 0.97 for the volume fraction of PLC in the anisotropic phase as low as 0.170. Thus, solvent molecules must be channeled by the thermotropic sequences, with perhaps unwilling flexible PLC sequences participating in the channeling. Available experimental data for one ternary systeml9 are compared with predictions from the theory. 1. Introduction and Scope Thermodynamic properties and phase diagrams of systems containing rigid-rod molecules can be predicted for a number of cases and correlated using a lattice model Flory: the first version was proposed in 19.56'~~ and expanded considerably later by Flory and collaborator^.^-'^ Numerous properties of polymer liquid crystals (PLCs) and their blends are advantageous in comparison to flexible polymer^.'^-^^ For this reason, in the preceding paper18 we adapted the Flory formalism to investigate the effects of varying the concentration 8 of liquid-crystalline se- quences in PLC copolymers on their properties. We shall now consider ternary systems of the type PLC + flexible polymer (FP) + solvent. Each PLC chain consists of both rigid (mesogenic, liquid-crystalline) and flexible sequences. A solvent molecule is assumed to be isodiametric with a polymer segment, be it rigid or flexible-a standard assumption in lattice models. One of the motivations of the present work was the existence of experimental data for systems of the type just defied, namely, LC copolymers of poly(ethy1ene tereph- thalate) withp-hydroxybenzoic acid, PET/zPHB (z is the mole fraction of PHB, the LC constituent) + poly- (bisphenol-A carbonate) (PC) + CHCl3. An attempt to use a version of the Flory theory assuming that the PLC chains are fully rigid did not produce satisfactory re~ults;'~ hence careful inclusion of the feature of partial flexibility of PLC chains was indicated. 2. Derivation of Principal Equations The ternary system contains n, solvent molecules and np polymer chains. We have np = n2 + n3, where the index 2 pertains to PLC and 3 to flexible chains. Each PLC chain is characterized by the fraction of LC sequences 8 = r h / ( r h + r c ) , where rh denotes the total number of L c (hard) segments in the chain and r, the respective number of flexible sequences. We shall take advantage of the work of Matheson and Flory," who considered a mixture of n, copolymers of + University of North Texas. Universiut Duisburg. various length r (r represents the degree of polymerization) in a solvent of n, quasi-spherical molecules. Our system may be recovered from theirs, by restricting the copolymers to only two classes: one with 8 # 0 and the other with 8 = 0. Beyond this simplification of the Matheson-Flory approach, however, we introduce additional terms dealing in a more rigorous way with anisotropic interactions between segments belonging to rigid sequences. So, specializing an expression of Matheson and Flory (eq 12 in ref 11) to our system, we have for the excess Gibbs function of mixing GM - _ - RT n, In n, + n2 In n2 + n3 In n3 - (n, + n2 + n,) In no + ?nP( 1 - :) - n,[(l - Q) In (1 - Q) + Q] - [r2n, (1 - 8) + r3n,l In 2, + x? npns - where 2, is the internal partition function of a flexible segment; no = n, + r2n2 + r3n3 = n, + pnp, where r2 and r3 are lengths of copolymers and flexible chains, respec- tively; n, is the total number of rigid sequences, each of average length q; nVy is the number of such rigid sequences characterized by an average disorientation parameter y; and cVy is the mean orientation-dependent interaction energy for a rodlike segment (belonging to such LC sequences) in the field of its neighbors; the quantity Q is given by 4 h and 42 denote respectively volume fractions of rigid sequences and PLC copolymer chains.

Conley and Olav K. Richter(cid:2) We dedicate this article to Harold Stark on the occasion of his 70th birthday Abstract. We prove that the center of the algebra of differential operators invariant under the action of the Jacobi group over a complex quadratic ﬁeld is generated by two cubic Casimir operators, which we compute explicitly. In the spirit of Borel, we consider Jacobi forms over complex quadratic ﬁelds that are also eigenfunctions of these Casimir operators, a new approach in the complex case. Theta functions and Eisenstein series provide standard examples. In addition, we introduce an analog of Kohnen’s plus space for modular forms of half-integral weight over K D Q.i /, and provide a lift from it to the space of Jacobi forms over K D Q.i/.

Introduction In 1985, Eichler and Zagier [7] systematically developed a theory of (holomorphic) Jacobi forms. That theory has since grown enormously, establishing deep connections to different types of automorphic forms (for example, see Skoruppa and Zagier [23] and Skoruppa [21]) and many other areas of mathematics and physics, such as the theory of Heegner points (see Gross, Kohnen, and Zagier [10]), the theory of elliptic genera (see Zagier [24]), string theory (for example, see Cardy [5]), and more recently, mock theta functions (see Zwegers [26]). The classical Jacobi forms in [7] are holomorphic functions. More generally, the Maass–Jacobi forms over the rationals in Berndt and Schmidt [1] and Pitale [17] are eigenfunctions of differential operators invariant under the action of the real Jacobi group. Automorphic forms over complex quadratic ﬁelds are clearly not (cid:2)The ﬁrst author was partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0757907.

1035	CZFKHL7VVFZYWIUJUVIIPJ7GP3DIAZ3N	2.NotForRepo	FIN 3770-001 Topic 1 Summer II 2000 Introductory Lecture: The Touchstones of Finance Learning Objectives Satisfied: 1. Introduction to Financial Management Objectives: Understand the following topics 4 What is the appropriate goal of the firm? 4 What is financial management? 4 What are the various forms of businesses, and the corporate tax structure? Also cover the major foundations of Finance such as 4 Agency problems 4 Diversification Purpose: Provide a framework for integrating the principles of finance into a conceptual whole. What is Finance? Finance is the study of the market processes which allocate society’s savings to the most productive uses. Finance is also concerned with how these market processes influence decision makers in business and government. Much of this effort involves the study of the process of valuing securities in the marketplace—and the monumental dimensions of this task can be appreciated by considering the following definition of a security given by the Supreme Court in the case of SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. (328 U.S. 293, 298, 299 (1946)): [A security is] a contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or third party. From this definition it can be seen that the problem of security valuation encompasses not only the valuation of a firm’s physical assets and the earning power derived from them, but also the valuation of its human capital, its organizational capital, and the structure of the incentives offered to those whose efforts will make or break the enterprise. Financial management within the firm should focus on insuring that resources under the firm’s control are channeled into the most productive uses. If management incentives are not structured effectively, there may be conflicts of interest between managers and owners. Such conflicts of interest are referred to as “agency problems” that give rise to various “agency costs” (such as perquisite consumption, shirking, and the lost opportunities resulting from poor investment decisions). Forms of Business Organization: • • Proprietorships: One owner, profits taxed as personal income Partnerships: Two or more owners, profits taxed as personal income General partnerships: All owners are personally liable Limited partnerships: General partners are personally liable; limited partners’ liability is limited to the amount invested in the business Master limited partnerships: Limited partnership units are transferrable (like stock in a corporation) Course handout Prof. Kensinger 1 - - -****************************************************************************************************

A timing problem occasionally occurs when a doctoral student enters the program with a thesis that is accepted by the DCT as meeting the Clinical Program’s standards. The student’s dissertation proposal must wait until the general and clinical core courses are successfully completed, and the qualifying exam is passed. This sequence could delay data collection by several years. The Clinical Committee discourages dissertation-delayed students from collecting their own dissertation data without the proper oversight. Oversight is provided by the following procedures: 1. The student must meet the basic requirements: The student must be in good standing with a master’s thesis from a different university that met the UNT Clinical Program’s standards. 2. The student must complete the IRB application. 3. The student must also complete a 1-2 page summary entitled “Methodological Review of Proposed Self-Initiated Archival Dataset for Dissertations.” 4. The major professor and one other clinical faculty must initial the Methodological Review as “adequate to proceed.” If the major professor is not a member of the clinical faculty, then a second clinical faculty must also initial it. The following outline should be followed for the Methodological Review 1. List of Research Questions with Proposed Analyses 2. Power Analysis 3. List of Measures 4. Population and Inclusion Criteria 5. Statement by the Student and Review by Faculty (see below) Statement by the Student: I realize that this is simply a methodological review regarding the adequacy of the sample and methods to address the research questions. I understand it will be entirely the responsibility of my dissertation committee to decide whether my proposal is adequate in terms of its scholarship, originality, and contributions to research. ________________________ Signature ________________________ Name _________ Date Clinical Faculty Review: This Self-Initiated Archival Dataset is “adequate to proceed” but with no assurances as to its success at the proposal or defense stages. __________________ Initial and date ____________________ Initial and date 52 The Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology at the University of North Texas is accredited by the American Psychological Association, Office of Program Consultation and Accreditation, 750 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002-4242. 202- 336-5979 Email:apaaccred@apa.org Web: www.apa.org/ed/accreditation****************************************************************************************************	Clinical_Psych_Manual_2014.docx.

886	7YV2XRZGR6DHX7EDEPUWA47EUCGUY246	2.NotForRepo	June 17, 2012 Jane Himmel Associate Director Center for Learning Enhancement, Assessment, and Redesign Dear Jane: I am pleased to have the opportunity to express my support for the Learning Enhancement Grant program. For the past several years I have been interested in creating an on line version of some of the finance classes that I teach, but my plans never quite translated into action. I thought that it would be difficult to deliver a technical topic like finance effectively, I didn’t know on line teaching strategies, and various other perceived reasons. Last fall I decided to apply for one of the Learning Enhancement grants, thinking that if I received the grant, I would get the necessary support and funding for my time, creating a commitment on my part to meet deadlines and complete the project. That in fact has been the case. Both the on line and face to face training that I have received from CLEAR has been very helpful to me in the development of my class. I have also discovered that there is a substantial amount of teaching material already available even for technical topics like finance. In addition, a considerable amount of the training material is valuable even for face to face classes, like the development of learning objectives. I believe that there is a significant need for more development of on line classes, both in my department and in the college. The class that I am developing for on line delivery has experienced significant enrollment declines over the past several semesters, so it is our hope that the more flexible delivery of the class on line will stimulate enrollment. With the assistance and support that I have received as a result of the grant, the project does not seem quite so daunting. The grant has given me the extra impetus I needed to launch a consistent effort to develop the class. I appreciate the university’s support of the development of on line classes with the grant program, not only for the funding provided, but also for signaling the backing of the administration for this important program. I plan to spend the second part of the summer bringing the project to near completion and hope to deliver the class on line next spring.

1368	YUGRFCBXNE4E7GGB4UF4WGL6DIHBK2XV	2.NotForRepo	University of North Texas Learning Enhancement Grants Final Report Due August 10, 2012 Proposer: Susan Squires Proposal Title: Evaluation Anthropology What were the key challenges you faced in completing your Learning Enhancement project as you proposed? The most challenging aspect faced during the development of this course were threefold 1) This is a co-authored course. Distance was a challenge for the two of us. While I am based in Denton, Mary Odell Butler is based in Washington BC. While working remotely we were able to develop course content but found we needed some face-to-face meetings to accomplish this. 2) A second challenge was about knowledge of Blackboard Learn. This is a new platform at UNT. Fortunately I had previous experience with it. Mary Odell Butler did not. We did have an hour tutorial from CLEAR but this only provide a basic orientation to the system. As a result I have spent more time than I scheduled in the grant to create the course pages and upload material. 3) Intellectual property rights became a third challenge as the Dept. of Anthropology had never hired an outside contractor to develop an online course and had to develop procedures to do so. If you developed a course as part of your project, when is it scheduled to be offered? Evaluation Anthropology will be offered during fall 2012. What, if anything, remains to be completed for your project and what is the schedule for project completion? All the content has been developed. To complete the development we need to 1. Complete the upload of the content to Blackboard Learn 2. Hold a second face-to-face meeting with Mary Odell Butler to review and finalize the course content. This meeting has been scheduled for August 29. Please provide information on any funds that were spent from the project budget since the last report (amount and purpose). Please also list any purchases that remain to be made with grant funds. All funds not expended by August 31, 2012 will be forfeited. All the funds for this project will be expended. A total of $5000 will go to pay Mary Odell Butler for developing the content of this course****************************************************************************************************	University of North Texas

You may choose to write about any two texts we’ve read in weeks 10-16. attendance policy: Attendance is mandatory and will be taken each class via sign-up sheet. Your absence will be considered “excused” if you notify me by email before your absence or shortly thereafter. Any student responsible for 2 or more unexcused absences will be asked to withdraw from the course. disability accommodation: Students must follow the Procedure for Requesting Special Accommodation, as indicated in the UNT Policy Manual, Volume 3, 18.1.14, part II. According to these guidelines, “The University of North Texas makes reasonable academic accommodation for students with disabilities. Students seeking accommodation must first register with the Office of Disability Accommodation (ODA) to verify their eligibility. If a disability is verified, the ODA will provide you with an accommodation letter to be delivered to faculty to begin a private discussion regarding your specific needs in a course. You may request accommodations at any time, however, ODA notices of accommodation should be provided as early as possible in the semester to avoid any delay in implementation. Note that students must obtain a new letter of accommodation for every semester and must meet with each faculty member prior to implementation in each class. For additional information see the Office of Disability Accommodation website at http://www.unt.edu/oda.

1207	PJPTOK6G5ZKTSER3W2KDIZYMQFWVPTIC	2.NotForRepo	Summer 2017 – Summer Payroll Processing Instructions Applicability: Timeline: Regular faculty (with budgeted positions during the fall/spring semesters), salaried graduate students, and adjuncts ePARs for 7-1 payroll should be submitted and approved by June 15. Please have to the Provost Office by noon on 6-8. FACULTY INSTRUCTIONS Summary of Summer Compensation Rules unless Documented Exception Granted by Provost • Rate factor = 2.5% per SCH (7.5% for 3 SCH) o Minimum Salary = $833.33 per SCH ($2,500 for 3 SCH) [with Incentives = $1,041.66/SCH]. Please note: if necessary, this minimum salary can be increased to match the salary paid to adjuncts in the department. o Maximum Salary = $2,833.33 per SCH ($8,500 for 3 SCH) [with Incentives = $3,541.67/SCH] • Maximum (Paid) Teaching Load Limits – applies to tenure/tenure track only NOTE FROM PROVOST: Deans and Chairs should handle summer teaching loads in the most responsible manner, maximizing the schedule to support student needs. The general guidelines that underscored the summer policy should still be respected: faculty should not be teaching more in the summer than they do in the long academic semesters. • Course Size – Incentive/Disincentive Schedule (NOTE: Do not apply disincentives to practicum or study abroad courses which may have lower enrollment than the rates prescribed below) Undergraduate Enrollment Impact on Base Salary 1 - 6 7 – 10 11-14 15 – 40 41 - 60 61 - 80 81+ -25% -15% -5% Neutral (0%) +5% +15% +25% Graduate Enrollment 1 - 3 4 - 5 6 – 7 8 - 20 21 - 40 41 - 60 61+ 1. The summer faculty spreadsheet is for reference and calculation only, but must be completed and returned to the Provost Office for use in verifying ePAR data. 2. All summer appointments must be submitted via ePAR. Please reference the instructions on the summer pay PowerPoint for step-by-step directions on ePAR entry and to locate information on FTE and semester dates. 3. To use the calculation formulas built into the spreadsheet, only fill in the columns highlighted in yellow. All other fields will calculate for you. Any errors found in the salaries should be referred to Melinda Lilly or Tami Patterson (x3951 or X3953). 4. The spreadsheet calculations should be used to calculate rates for teaching appointments only. Please note that Column J “Monthly Salary” is the faculty member’s regular monthly rate of pay. This figure can be used to calculate Faculty Research (Job Code 1301) and Faculty Program/Project Coordinator (Job Code 1233) appointments. 5. The spreadsheet is divided into three tabs. Each tab represents a different summer pay period. Please read the notes on the top of each tab to identify the pay period covered on that tab. The GREEN Total section on each tab can be used for ePAR data entry. This area will calculate the monthly salary and FTE that should be entered for teaching during that particular pay period. o The first tab should be used for calculating teaching payments for Summer I, 8 Week, and Maymester (if Maymester salary paid in Summer I), with ePAR effective date of 6-1 and appointment end date of 7-15. o The second tab should be used for calculating teaching payments for Summer II or Maymester (if Maymester salary is paid in Summer II), with ePAR effective date of 7-16 and appointment end date of 8-31. o The third tab should be used for calculating teaching payments for 10 Week or Summer with ePAR effective date of 6-1 and appointment end date of 8-31. 6. Please note that you will need to submit separate ePARs for appointments that have different start/end dates, different job code, different rates of pay, different funding sources, and/or different monthly payment amounts. For example, you can submit one ePAR for a faculty member teaching 1 Maymester course and 1 Summer I course. However, you would need to submit two separate ePARs for a faculty member teaching Summer I and also serving in a 1301 research appointment. Similarly, you would need to submit two separate ePARs for a faculty member teaching Summer I and also teaching a 10 Week course.****************************************************************************************************	Summer 2007 – Payroll Processing Instructions

CATALOGUE INFORMATION  Catalogue Description: Writing as a means of ordering and shaping experience, information and ideas. Emphasis on perfecting texts through several drafts.  Foundational (Core) Component Area: Communication (English Composition and Rhetoric)  Core Objectives Assessed: Critical Thinking Skills, Communication Skills, Teamwork, and Personal Responsibility PROGRAM MISSION The First-Year Writing Program at the University of North Texas studies and practices writing as a complex activity that is defined not only by material processes, historical forms, and conventional grammars, but also by acts of discovering, exploring, and listening to the world around us. Students in our program have a stake in shaping the world through writing, and our job is to aid them in that process. Our courses prepare students to intervene in a variety of communities, including both academic and nonacademic contexts. Through our curriculum, students learn to use a wide repertoire of strategies, styles, forms, and conventions in order to engage most effectively with diverse audiences. Strong habits of rhetorical analysis and production are developed in a number of effective classroom practices, including collaboration, discussion, reflection, and, of course, frequent opportunities to write and revise. Overall, we invite students to question what they know about writing: this process of questioning includes exploring new forms, processes, and contexts for writing that are evolving constantly around us. By the time students have completed the courses in the Introductory Writing sequence, they will be prepared for the demands of writing that they encounter in their future academic studies and professional lives. COURSE TEXTS: REQUIRED TEXTBOOKS:  An Insider’s Guide to Academic Writing (Guide); Miller-Cochran/Stamper/Cochran; ISBN: 978- 1319020309 REQUIRED MATERIALS: In addition to your course textbooks, plan to have a Moleskine notebook for the Hupomnemata assignment (see below) and a reliable internet connection to complete the online components of this course. BRING TEXTBOOK, HUPOMNEMATA, AND LOOSE-LEAF PAPER TO CLASS EACH DAY. MAKEUP/LATE ASSIGNMENT POLICY: Late work for this course will not be accepted. Any quizzes or in-class exercises missed for any reason cannot be made up for points once missed. Additionally, all written assignments must be turned in at the beginning of class on the day that they are due in order to be counted for credit. If you know in advance that you will need to be absent for a class period, make arrangements with your instructor at least two weeks before the scheduled absence.

COURSE STRUCTURE This course is based on in-class lecture and discussion, and readings. It is web-augmented using the course management system, Blackboard Learn. You will use your UNT account to login to the course from the UNT Blackboard Learn page. COURSE DESCRIPTION This course analyzes the history of modern America, from its rise as an industrial and military power in the late nineteenth century to the Presidency of Barack Obama. It charts the revolutions in business, morals, politics, race relations, and everyday living that have transformed American life over the past century and a quarter. Contemporary American society emerged out of the complex legacy of a nation born out of the struggle for liberty and equality as promised in the founding documents of this country. The historical realities of class, racial, and gender oppression as well as imperialist expansion, however, have called persistently into question America’s commitment to those same ideals. The complex and contested relation between the reality of American culture and its mythical image forms the basis of this course as we explore whom we are as a nation, where we came from, and more importantly, where we are headed. COURSE GOALS Attain and demonstrate a better understanding of some of the broad themes and important subjects of American history – e.g., "sense of mission," religious diversity, imperialism, democracy, capitalism, racism, and slavery – and their lasting effects on the United States today. Attain a better understanding of what history is (i.e., the activity by which we analyze critically the human past) to develop your knowledge of how historians cover, describe, and explain the behaviors and interactions among individuals, groups, institutions, events, and ideas. Develop and improve your reading, critical thinking, and writing skills in relation to historical knowledge, issues, and the analysis of primary and secondary sources (i.e., improve your own intellectual self-reliance). REQUIRED READINGS & COURSE MATERIALS There are three books for this course, an e-book textbook package (includes a text and primary document reader) and a document reader as follows: Liberty and Power in America Package Volume 2 This is an e-book package (textbook and primary document reader). A pin-code may be purchased at the bookstore, or you may go directly to the publisher at http://nunnmcginty.com/unt/cox.

The Advisory Council recently amended the OLLI at UNT Policies and Procedures (formerly Bylaws of the Emeritus College) to help meet these challenges as well as to provide more opportunities for members to become involved in the life and conduct of the program. The OLLI at UNT Advisory Council is made up of nine (9) persons elected from the general membership (five elected in even numbered years and four in odd numbered years). Terms of service are two years, with the possibility of serving a second consecutive term. Persons being nominated will be asked to provide a brief statement indicating their interest, their experience with OLLI at UNT (and the Emeritus College) and their willingness to serve. Persons making a nomination are encouraged to ensure that nominees have agreed to the nomination. Self- nominations are welcome. The newly revised OLLI AT UNT Policies and Procedures document describes the responsibilities of the Advisory Council: “The Advisory Council reviews and approves policy in consultation with the Director of OLLI at UNT. The responsibilities of the Advisory Council include evaluating all OLLI at UNT policies, programs and operations and providing strategic planning for the growth and quality of the program. “ STANDING COMMITTEES OLLI at UNT’s standing committees are very important in carrying out the functions of the program. The term of service is one year for Standing Committees. Standing Committee Members may extend their term of service for a second consecutive term. Standing Committees and their primary responsibilities are: Curriculum Committee: The Curriculum Committee assists the Director of OLLI at UNT and staff in developing plans for a stimulating, well-balanced schedule of classes for each academic term. The committee works in partnership with the Director of OLLI at UNT to identify and recruit instructors and class proposals. Prior to each academic term the committee reviews class proposals and class evaluations and recommends classes for final review and selection by the Director of OLLI at UNT.****************************************************************************************************

The field originated from the merging, in the late 1970’s, of several biological disciplines. Many of the practitioners of these disciplines were concerned with the loss of biodiversity and natural ecosystems. Currently many conservation biologists are especially concerned with species decline and loss, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and the effects of global climate change. Throughout the semester, topics covered in the course will utilize ideas from all areas of biology as well as some areas of the social sciences. Course Requirements and Grading: Your grade in the course will be based on three lecture exams, two written assignments, class participation, and an oral presentation. Grading is based on the following: Exams 1 & 2 Final Exam Written Assignment 1 Written Assignment 2 Oral Presentation Participation 200 pts (100 pts each) 150 pts (100 pts new material, 50 pts cumulative) 50 pts 100 pts 50 pts 50 pts The following scale will be used to determine the “letter grade” received in the course: 90-­‐100%= A; 80-­‐89% = B; 70-­‐79% = C; 60-­‐69% = D; < 60% = F You are allowed three class absences, but the fourth and fifth absence each will result in a 15-­‐point deduction (5% of total points possible). The sixth absence will result in course withdrawal. Lectures, videos and class discussions will contain vital information needed to do well on the exams.

The primary concern for survivors of sexual violence is safety and to address medical issues related to injury, sexually transmitted infections, and/or pregnancy. The secondary concern is evidence collection to aid in a possible investigation. o Get to a safe place immediately. Go to your apartment/home, residence hall, or the residence of a trusted friend. Do not change your clothing or shower in order to preserve physical evidence. If you change your clothes, it is important that they are kept in a paper bag. Do not apply medication to any injuries that have been sustained unless absolutely necessary. Do not drink or chew gum, or o Get medical attention as soon as possible. disturb anything in the area where the assault occurred. Once you are in a safe place, medical attention at the local hospital is important to address medical issues related to the assault, and to preserve valuable evidence should you decide to seek prosecution through the criminal o Seek free, confidential counseling at the justice system. It is important to know if you go to the hospital, the police may be contacted. Counseling and Testing Center. Call 940-565-2741. Help is available for the person assaulted and for UNT students helping a survivor of sexual assault. Other free local counseling resources are available. o Utilize campus resources. The Survivor Advocate may be able to assist with changes in academic or living arrangements if accommodations are available. What if I was under the influence of drugs/ alcohol at the time of the sexual assault? Use of alcohol or drugs impacts an individual's ability to consent to a sexual act and DOES NOT put the at .

WHAT TO DO ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE A survivor of sexual violence have a might wide range of emotions following an incident. It is important to utilize available resources or refer someone you know who has been assaulted to receive necessary care and begin to process the events. Going to a hospital immediately following the incident provides survivors with urgent care as well as an opportunity for valuable evidence collection.

Sexual violence can occur between friends, classmates, spouses, romantic interests, acquaintances, or strangers. Violence? Examples of sexual violence include: (cid:129) (cid:129) (cid:129) (cid:129) rape sexual assault sexual battery sexual coercion Dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking are also serious offenses. Please see deanofstudents.unt.edu for additional information on these issues. UNT Survivor Advocate The UNT Survivor Advocate's role is to connect students impacted by violence to resources (counseling, health, safety, academic, legal, etc.), and to act as their advocate. The Survivor Advocate can assist a student by contacting instructors for absences related to an assault, working with Housing to facilitate a room change, filing protective orders, completing crime victim's compensation applications, and connecting students to the many other resources that are available, both on and off campus. The Survivor Advocate can be reached by emailing SurvivorAdvocate@unt.edu or calling the Dean of Students Office at 940-565-2648. Please remember if this happens to you, you are NOT alone. Consider seeking out appropriate support.

This Brief is entitled: The Unmet Needs of Children with Special Health Care Needs and was prepared by Rachael Jackson, MPH, Asso- ciate Director for Center for Community Health and Sarah Barraza, Graduate Stu- dent Assistant, Center for Community Health. Dr. Kimberly piloted the Brief with contributions from Kristine Lykens, PhD; Karan Singh, PhD, Sejong Bae, PhD, Katandria Johnson, MA, Kristen Hahn, MPH, and Roberto Cardarelli, DO, MPH. Dr. Fulda details in the Brief the premise that children with special health care needs (CSHCN) are a unique popula- tion with a variety of needs and under our current system of care, both nationally and at the state level, many of those needs are unmet. She surmises that changes in health care systems, the including number of doctors and nurses providing care to CSHCN and improving access to a medical home, as well as changes in public policy, such as increasing reimbursement rates and decreasing eligibility require- ments for Medicaid/SCHIP, can help to alleviate the burden of the conditions ex- perienced by CSHCN. The Brief will be distributed early in September and will be posted to the PCRI website at http:// www.hsc.unt.edu/pcri/research_pubs.htm increasing “Be faithful in small things be- cause it is in them that your strength lies”. -- Mother Teresa Dr. Kitzman Publishes Two Articles Dr. Heather Kitzman-Ulrich, Assis- tant Professor, UNT Health Science Cen- ter, Family Medicine Department has an- nounced the publication of two separate articles recently.

A Grandfather clock has a pen- dulum that swings back and forth at a regular rate which is the mechanism that keeps the clock accurate. He plans to make the pen- dulum from a heavy object that is supported by a very light wire. Joe wishes to have the period of the pendulum to be 2 seconds be- cause that seems like a “grandfatherly” rate - not too fast, but still moving along steadily. Your job is to complete this activity and in the end, ﬁnd how long the pendulum should be. The problem. You are to analyze the ge- ometry and physics of the situation in order to ﬁnd a diﬀerential equation to model the motion of the pendulum. Then you will ﬁnd a solution to the equation and determine the length of the pendulum which will make the pendulum swing a full cycle in two seconds. A well known concept in physics is that the net force on an object accelerates the object by the equation F = ma where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceler- ation. This is a diﬀerential equation since a = x(cid:48)(cid:48)(t) where x(t) measures the position of the object at time t. In the case of a pen- dulum, the mass follows a circular path. Let x represent the distance along the circle from the equilibrium point (position when there is no motion) with x positive to the right and x negative to the left. Procedure. There may be several ways to approach the problem, but you are asked to follow the steps outlined below. 1. Use the following drawing and trigonom- etry to resolve the force F into a com- ponent tangent to the circle and a com- ponent perpendicular to the circle. Note the the force of gravity is mg, so the force F in the picture is the force experienced by the object along its path of motion. (The component of the force perpendic- ular to the path is canceled by the force the support wire exerts on the mass.) 2. Assume as usual that the positive direc- tion is to the right and the negative di- rection is to the left. Should the sign of your answer in part 1) be positive or negative? 3. In class, we proved that lim x→0 = 1. Explain why it is reasonable to replace sin θ with θ as long as the pendulum does not swing very far.

We will begin with the logic of social scientific inquiry and the basics of research design, and then move on to the quantitative methods that are commonly used by political scientists to study important political questions. You will also learn SPSS, a widely-used statistical program. 2. Course Objectives By the end of the course, you will be able to: • Formulate research questions and hypotheses • Design a research project involving data analysis • Explain quantitative results to a regular person • Employ basic statistical methods to test hypotheses about politics 3. Required Text Philip H. Pollock III. 2011. The Essentials of Political Analysis, 4th ed. CQ Press. ISBN: 978-1608716869 4. Requirements & Evaluation 3 exams & 4 assignments 90% (the lowest one will be dropped, and each of the top six will be worth 15%) In-class exercises 10% • Exams There will be three exams including a cumulative final exam. Since you have one exam or assignment to drop, makeup or rescheduled exams will not be given unless most extreme and unusual circumstances force you to miss two. The instructor has the discretion to decide whether and when a makeup exam will be granted. If you arrive significantly late for an exam, your exam score will be penalized. You will need a calculator with a square root ny key (but you may not use a graphing calculator). You may not use your cell phone or a communication device as a calculator during an exam. • Assignments There will be four assignments. Detailed handouts will be provided and be available on Blackboard. Late submissions will be severely penalized. Technical malfunctions (e.g., computer viruses, disk crash, printer problems) do not necessarily constitute acceptable excuses for lateness. Always be sure to save your work and make backups and leave yourself enough time to deal with unexpected problems. 1****************************************************************************************************	Political Science 140:

Course Description This course is meant to examine the conditions that make for war and peace in world politics, as well as the range of possible solutions that might help to prevent this problem in the future. The course begins with an examination of historical patterns and trends in modern warfare. Later sections of the course then examine the causes or correlates of war between nation-states, the outcomes and consequences of war, and a variety of solutions that have been offered to help prevent or limit war. Upon completion of this course, students should be familiar with many of the factors that seem to create, worsen, or reduce military conflict between nation-states. Students should be able to apply these factors in examining real-world scenarios, such as studying historical cases of war or assessing the prospects for future conflict in troubled areas of the world. Students are expected to finish the course readings before the class period for which they are assigned, attend class regularly, show up to class on time, and participate actively in class discussion. The course will also require a midterm, quizzes, a research paper, and a final exam. Required Texts • Books: All of these should be available at the usual Denton locations, or maybe cheaper through online bookstores -- but wherever you buy them, be sure to get the correct editions! --Patrick M. Morgan (2006), International Security: Problems and Solutions, 1st ed. Washington, D.C.: CQ Press. --Richard Overy (2011), 1939: Countdown to War. New York: Penguin Books. • JSTOR: An academic journal service that UNT provides for us. Access is free through the UNT Libraries web site; you can search for individual articles by author, title, or keyword, or browse by journal name and issue. The online version of the syllabus includes direct links to all assigned JSTOR articles. • Blackboard: The remaining readings are made available through this course's Blackboard page. Course Requirements (1) Examinations: two noncumulative essay exams are required. The first exam will be given in class; the second exam will be given in the regular class room on the day and time that UNT assigns for the course's final exam. Each exam will be worth 25% of the total course grade. Be sure to be on time; once the first student leaves the exam, anybody else who enters to take the exam will lose five letter grades. (2) Research Papers: one 10-15 page research paper is required for this class, which will count for 40% of the total course grade; more details are provided at the end of this syllabus. This paper will be due at the beginning of class on the due date, and must be turned in through TurnItIn (accessible through the Blackboard site for this course); papers turned in after class starts will be assessed a late penalty. Note that late papers will lose one full letter grade for each day that they are late, with the penalty increasing at midnight each day. (3) Preparation, Attendance, and Participation: Students are expected to complete the assigned readings before class, attend class regularly, and participate actively in class discussion. Class preparation will be measured through approximately 6-10 (unannounced) quizzes given at the very beginning or ending of class periods, which together will be worth 10% of the total course grade; each student's quiz grade will be determined by dropping his/her lowest quiz score.****************************************************************************************************	*PSCI 4821 Syllabus (2015F)

Henry, Jordan, Nuñez-Janes, ReCruz, Wasson. The Department of Anthropology offers both on- campus and online graduate programs leading to the following degrees: • Master of Arts, and • Master of Science, both with a major in applied anthropology. In cooperation with the UNT Health Science Cen- ter in Fort Worth, students may also earn a dual degree in public health with a specialty in community health. The master’s degree in applied anthropology is grounded in the theory and methods of anthropol- ogy, and is designed primarily to prepare students for employment outside academia. Students will be prepared to apply anthropological knowledge in pri- vate and public sectors, foundations, and businesses in local, regional, and international areas. Knowl- edge is to be applied to our most compelling social problems and to the operation and administration of agencies charged with addressing these problems. The central goal of our program in applied anthro- pology is to provide the knowledge necessary for its graduates to undertake informed and thoughtful action as street-level practitioners, administrators, agency-based researchers and program evaluators. Research Faculty have expertise in migration, border stud- ies, race and ethnicity, technology and cyberspace, organizational anthropology, globalization, marketing, consumer behavior, product design, medical anthro- pology, public health, sociocultural impact analysis, directed change and development, urban centers, sustainable communities, bilingual education, and ecological and environmental anthropology.

Monday by appointment. Learning objectives This course will delve more deeply into advertising concepts and issues. You’ll learn to think critically about advertising and be able to critique ads. We’ll sort through the concept of account planning and how it’s different from account management. And you’ll learn different ways to understand people — something essential in advertising. We’ll also read some of the advertising literature, which will give a foundation for those going into advertising. Repeatedly professionals tell me: teach them to think, teach them to write, teach them to present. You’ll be doing a whole lot of all three in this class. It should be noted that while this isn’t a creative class (as in creating ads), you’re still expected to be creative. Advertising is a creative industry, even for those who aren’t actually creating the ads. In this class you’ll show your creativity primarily through your thinking, your writing in assignments and projects and in your presentations. Accrediting standards The Department of Journalism, now the School of Journalism, has been accredited by the Accrediting Council for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (ACEJMC) since 1969. About one-fourth of all journalism and mass communications programs in the United States are accredited by ACEJMC. National accreditation enhances your education here by certifying that the school adheres to standards established by the council. This course will help you meet the following student learning outcomes that have been established by ACEJMC: • Demonstrate an understanding of the history and role of professionals and institutions in shaping communications. • Demonstrate an understanding of the diversity of groups in a global society in relationship to communications. • Understand concepts and apply theories in the use and presentation of images and information. • Work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness and diversity. • Think critically, creatively and independently. • Conduct research and evaluate information by methods appropriate to the communications professions in which you work. • Write correctly and clearly in forms and styles appropriate for the communications professions, audiences and purposes you will serve.****************************************************************************************************	11a posted syllabi F2010

The following prices are observed. Formulate an arbitrage strategy to profit from the situation. • Euro per Dollar exchange rate is 0.90 spot. • Pound per Dollar exchange rate is .70 spot. • Euro per Pound exchange rate is 1.35 spot. 2. The following prices are observed.

Note: Next, we’ll consider some basic commodity problems. 3. The following prices are observed. Formulate an arbitrage strategy to profit from the situation. • Wheat is $2.00 per bushel spot and $2.30 per bushel for 180-day futures. • U.S. interest rate is 10.00% APR compounded daily. • Storage cost in a bonded, insured warehouse is $0.10 per bushel (prepaid) for a 180-day period, and you already have an inventory of one million bushels in storage. 4. The following prices are observed. Formulate an arbitrage strategy to profit from the situation. • Wheat is $2.00 per bushel spot and $2.03 per bushel for 180-day futures. • U.S. interest rate is 10.00% APR compounded daily. • Storage cost in a bonded, insured warehouse is $0.10 per bushel (prepaid) for a 180-day period, and you already have an inventory of one million bushels in storage. 5. Problems 3 and 4 illustrate the role of storage cost and interest in establishing the basis. Some have argued that “convenience yield” is also a factor in establishing the basis. Convenience value may be real for specific individuals or companies, but some conditions must be met before such factors translate into reductions in the basis for a commodity. Discuss the necessary conditions for convenience value to influence market value (so that the futures price is at “less than full carry”). 6. Be prepared to describe “backwardation” and discuss the factors that cause it. Ditto for “contango” and the factors that cause it. Can backwardation and contango both be present for a particular commodity, for contracts with different expirations?
