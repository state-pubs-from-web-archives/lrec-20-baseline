Copyright © by the Southern Rural Sociological Association SHARING WATER INTERNATIONALLY, PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE—MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES® JOHN M. DONAHUE TRINITY UNIVERSITY and IRENE J. KLAVER UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS ABSTRACT Conflicts over the sharing of the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo and Colorado Rivers between the United States and Mexico are usually understood in spatial terms. In this paper we argue for the need to add a temporal horizon. A larger historical context will reveal that water management, including water allocation and river politics, has always been influenced by larger social-political and cultural frameworks. These temporal shifts are sequential, but overlapping so that current policies as cultural constructs operate within the framework of previous treaty obligations though the historical contexts have changed. The Rio Grande/Rio Bravo is still defined as a border separating two countries. There is emerging at the grassroots level an understanding of the watershed as an ecological resource that unites the two countries. Bringing together the cultural definitions of the river as political boundary that separates and a basin that unites is already underway. Conflicts over the sharing of the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo’ and Colorado Rivers between the United States and Mexico are usually understood in spatial terms. In this paper we argue for the need to add a temporal horizon. A larger historical context will reveal that water management, including water allocation and river politics, has always been influenced by larger social-political and cultural frameworks. This is important to acknowledge since it means that tentative shifts in current social-political configurations might promise fruitful directions for conflict negotiation strategies. We will specifically foreground two recent cultural developments, namely, the growing emphasis on and interest in public participation (Gregory 2000; McDaniels, Gregory, and Fields 1999; Mumme and Brown 2002; Walsh 2004), and the increasing acknowledgment of the relevance of environmental flows (Poffet al. “Send comments to John M.

Marshall, Beta Eta 2003, Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas, Denton, TX 76203-5070, jimm@unt.edu A Dinner Party in Glasgow, Scotland. During a social gathering in 1913 at the home of his in- laws, Frederick Soddy (1877–1956) (Figure 1) was musing what to call a new concept. For a decade a plethora of radioelements, each with a unique half-life, had been discovered at various universities throughout Europe and North America, and there was no room in the Periodic Table to accommodate them. To solve this prob- lem, Soddy was proposing that radioelements with different half-lives but with the same chemical properties should be confined in one box in the Table. The scholarly Dr. Margaret Todd (1859–1918), an M.D. and novelist friend of his wife, Winifred, suggested1 such elements be denoted by the Greek words “same place” (“iso-topos”) (Figure 2). Soddy shortly announced his idea of “isotopes” (December 4, 1913) in the prestigious journal Nature.2 The Life of Frederick Soddy.3 A native of Eastbourne in East Sussex, 85 km south of London, Frederick Soddy was trained at the University of Aberystwyth (Wales) and at Oxford University, graduating in 1898. After three years as researcher at Oxford, Soddy accepted the position of Demonstrator at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. After a year he joined the group of Ernest Rutherford 68 Figure 1. The home of Sir George and Lady Beilby, the parents of Frederick Soddy’s wife, Winifred, at 11 University Gardens, Glasgow, Scotland. The home is of Victorian architecture and was built in 1884. Sir George was an industrial chemist who furnished 50 kilograms of uranyl nitrate to Soddy for his experiments. This home served as a popular meeting place for politics, science, business, and leisure. In the drawing-room of this home, the word “isotope” was coined by Soddy at the suggestion of Dr. Margaret Todd. at that university, who was just beginning to investigate the strange emanation from thori- um.4c For the next two years the two colleagues established the elemental nature of thoron (radon-220), developed the understanding of radioactive half-lives, and discovered the nat- ural transmutation of the elements.4c It was actually Soddy the chemist, well versed in the history of alchemy, who first understood the significance of transmutation, before Ruther - ford the physicist.3 In 1903, Soddy returned to England and joined the research group of William Ramsay (1852–1916; the discoverer of the noble gases) at University College, London, to study the decay by-products of radium. In Ramsay’s lab- oratory, Soddy established that helium was produced during the decay of radium, thus furnishing the first evidence of the transmuta- Figure 2.

After 10 years at Glasgow, Soddy moved to the University of Aberdeen (1914–1919), where he co-discovered the element protactinium (“eka-tantalum”). World War I had a distressing effect on Soddy; the death of Henry Moseley 4d elicited the fol- lowing from Soddy,3 “When Moseley was killed at Gallipoli I felt enraged. Sometimes I think that something snapped in my brain. . . . I felt that governments and politicians, or man in general, was not yet fitted to use science.” Soddy moved in 1919 to Oxford University, where with a new mission he tried to establish economic policy based on scientific laws. He retired in 1936, after a frustrating period in his life, with a “sense of failure. . . . in the field of economics.” He was at Oxford when he accept- ed the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his research in radio-elements and isotopy at Glasgow, and for teaching us that atoms could have “identical outsides but different insides.”5 The Discovery of the Radioelements (see Figure 3).

BURGGREN* Department of Biology, University of Calgary, Calgary T2N 1N4, Alberta, Canada, and * Zoology Department, University of Massachusetts, Amherts Ma 01003, U.S.A. (Received 13 July 1978) SUMMARY The frequencies of heart (fH) and scaphognathite (ventilatory = /Bo) pumping, and responses to hypoxia, hypercapnia and wetting (simulated rain), as well as oxygen consumption (Mo%), pre- and postbranchial haemo- lymph oxygen tension (Po,)> oxygen content (COi), carbon dioxide content (Ceo,) a nd pH were measured in adult land crabs Coenobita clypeatus. There was a large increase in /8C in response to both hypoxia and wetting but a smaller increase in response to even severe hypercapnia. Some evidence suggests that ventilation via the scaphognathites may have been supplemented by a second (branchiostegal) pump when ventilatory requirement was high. fH was less responsive to either hypoxia or hypercapnia, but decreased with severe exposure to either. Haemolymph oxygen tensions were low (Po.o, = 14, PvOt = 8) but haemocyanin oxygen affinity was high in vivo (PK = 10 torr at 23 °C) and postbranchial haemocyanin was 60-80% saturated. Oxygen content was also high allowing adequate oxygen release to the tissues despite the low oxygen tensions. APM/A* = 0-37 torr/A °C, log APM/ApH = — 0-84 torr/pH unit, both determined in vitro were lower than literature values for marine and littoral species. As in other terrestrial species, CCOt and PQO, (calculated) were high, as were both bicarbonate and non-bicar- bonate buffering capacities. Water loss was less (0-08% body weight, h"1) in Coenobita than in other terrestrial crustaceans, this resulting from the protection of the adopted shell. Results obtained from Coenobita are com- pared with those from other terrestrial and littoral crabs to illustrate the influence of the adopted shell on the degree of modification needed to enter terrestrial habitats. INTRODUCTION The mechanisms of physiological compensation to environmental change exhibited by terrestrial decapodan crustaceans are of particular interest in understanding the evolution of terrestrial life.

Relationships between humans and nature take multiple forms. This is a fundamental issue in conservation but one that is often neglected, leading to poor conservation outcomes. It is thus imperative that we come to understand better the complex relationships between humans and nature. To do so, we need to examine “nature” and the often assumed dichotomy between humans and nature. We conducted a qualitative social research inquiry to explore the societal relationships with nature in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve in Chile. From the results, we developed a framework that illustrates how different “natures” are created in the three-way relationship among the individual, society, and the physical world. We further discuss the implications of the co-existence of various “natures” in one place. Their explicit consideration bears important potential for improving conservation practice. The framework can then serve as a heuristic tool for uncovering and addressing challenges in other conservation contexts. Key Words: biodiversity; biosphere reserve; Chile; conflicts; conservation; local ecological knowledge; participation; protected areas; valuation INTRODUCTION Relationships between humans and nature take multiple forms. This is a fundamental issue in conservation but one that is often neglected, leading to poor conservation outcomes. It is thus imperative that we come to a better understanding of the complex relationships between humans and nature. To do so, we need to examine “nature” and the often assumed dichotomy between humans and nature. This requires extending the notion of human needs beyond purely economic ones and also considering how nature is created and shaped by political contexts, cultural values, personal ties, and other determinants. e.g., Nature conservation has always vacillated between preservationist approaches that exclude humans from nature, the wilderness debate (Oehlschlaeger 1991, Cronon 1995, Callicott and Nelson 1998, Sarkar 1999, Nelson and Callicott 2008), and approaches that incorporate human needs and values in an attempt to reconcile them with the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems (Posey 1999, Infield 2001, Maffi 2001, WCPA 2000, 2004). The evolution of the IUCN Protected Area Management Categories reflects this debate at the international level, and the question of whether the sustainable use of natural resources is valid as an objective for a protected area remains a highly contested one (Terborgh 2004, Locke and Dearden 2005, IUCN 2008). Although human activities in protected areas are referred to in categories V and VI, the implication is one of incremental degrees of human intervention, such that untouched nature is still regarded as the “better” or the “real” nature. The description of category V found in the guidelines for applying the categories states that “[b]eing a relatively flexible model, category V may sometimes offer conservation options where more strictly protected areas are not feasible” (IUCN 2008:21). This “nature first” approach is rooted in the national park concept (Runte 1997) and has guided much ecological research (Shelford 1943, Tjossem 1994, Arcese and Sinclair 1997, Sinclair 1998). At the same time, the recommendations that emerged from the Fifth World Parks Congress 2003 in Durban (IUCN 2003) strongly urge that conservation should not lead to further social injustices and that the establishment of a protected 1Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ, 2University of North Texas, 3Universidad de Magallanes (Chile)****************************************************************************************************	Many Eyes on Nature: Diverse Perspectives in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve and Their Relevance for Conservation

Methyl acrylate is introduced into the mesoporous silica that has an interconnected porous structure, allowing monomer diffusion into the pores before the polymerization reaction. In order to improve the silica plus polymer adhesion and to decrease the silica agglomeration, the silanol groups of the silica are functionalized with methyl groups without decreasing significantly the pore size. The silica is characterized by nitrogen adsorption, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The nanohybrids so obtained are analyzed by tensile testing, thermogravimetry (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA). The highest improvement of mechanical and thermophysical properties is achieved for nanohybrids containing 5 wt. % mesoporous silica. At 10 % silica, agglomeration of the filler takes place and the dispersed phase is less effective in reinforcing the polymer matrix. Key words: nanohybrid, mesoporous silica, poly(methyl acrylate), mechanical properties, thermophysical properties. Introduction The use of fibers and fillers to improve mechanical and thermophysical properties of polymer-based materials (PBMs) constitutes a rapidly growing field [1 - 12]. Among others silica, titanium oxide, zeolites, or carbon nanotubes are used. The filler is typically a stiff material, thus providing a mechanical reinforcement and enhanced thermal stability at elevated temperatures. The type of the reinforcing agent affects the level of properties that can be achieved and there are certain limitations. Thus, Bismarck and coworkers [12] conclude that in hot water environments carbon-fiber reinforced poly(ether ether ketone) can only be used well below the glass transition temperature of the matrix. Sandler and coworkers [10] note that in fine structures, such as spun fibers or microinjection moldings, conventional chopped fibers cannot be physically accommodated while carbon nanotubes can. Among PBMs with reinforcement, nanohybrids seem interesting where the filler or reinforcing phase of the polymer consists of inorganic particles with dimensions < 100 nm; the resulting PBM escapes the traditional classification of materials into inorganic and organic [13].

The present study examined physiological measures of affect when viewing images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), computer-generated still images, and computer-generated videos of feared and non-feared stimuli. Twenty low fear (LF) and twelve high fear (HF) individuals viewed static and moving images of spiders and snakes. In both LF and HF subjects, computer-generated video images elicited more intense affective responses than the IAPS images and the computer-generated stills. Computer- generated still images were as effective in eliciting fear responses as the IAPS. These results suggest that computer-generated images can be as or more effec- tive as the IAPS in eliciting fear. Regardless of modality, HF subjects showed stronger physiological responses to their specifically feared stimulus (snake or spider) than to a non-feared stimulus.

From an evolutionary perspective, fear was developed in order to facilitate an organism’s response to threat. It motivates escape from, and avoidance of, dangerous stimuli in the natural world. Accordingly, much empirical attention has been focused on deconstructing the mechanisms through which humans process and react to fear-producing stimuli. 1.1 Elicitation of Fear in the Laboratory The study of fear responses in the laboratory has often used emotion laden pictures, such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS, [1]). The IAPS consists of pictures meant to evoke negative, positive, or neutral affect. This collection of pic- tures has become the standard in psychological studies of emotion. The IAPS offers many advantages, including extensive normative data and evidence of stability across laboratories in different countries [2]. D.D. Schmorrow et al.

It is asymptotically slower than the relabel-to-front algorithm, which runs in O(V3) time, but it is often faster in practice for sparse graphs. The algorithm was first published by Yefim (Chaim) Dinic in 1970 and independently published by Jack Edmonds and Richard Karp in 1972. Dinic's algorithm includes additional techniques that reduce the running time to O(V2E). Algorithm The algorithm is identical to the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm, except that the search order when finding the augmenting path is defined. The path found must be a shortest path that has available capacity. This can be found by a breadth-first search, as we let edges have unit length. The running time of O(V E2) is found by showing that each augmenting path can be found in O(E) time, that every time at least one of the E edges becomes saturated, that the distance from the saturated edge to the source along the augmenting path must be longer than last time it was saturated, and that the length is at most V. Another property of this algorithm is that the length of the shortest augmenting path increases monotonically. There is an accessible proof in Introduction to Algorithms.

Coach John Wooden always preached to his players to not get too high or too low, but to stay consistent play to play and game to game. Performing consistently is a key to performing successfully, but consistency is more than just game to game or play to play. Here are some ideas for how you can help your team/athletes perform consistently: ‐ Use Goals to Focus Practice and Training: link what you do in training to the goals you have set for your team and for your individual athletes. Let your players know before every practice what you expect of them and how what you are doing today will help them achieve their goals. At the end of practices, take a moment to evaluate how well the athletes worked in meeting the practice expectations. ‐ Create Consistent Pre‐Performance Routines: how you practice, influences how you compete…but also how you prepare in the weeks, days, hours, and even minutes before a competition can determine how well you do. It is no surprise that the athletes and teams who perform consistently also have well‐developed pre‐performance routines that they implement consistently. These routines help athletes and teams become physically and mentally ready to compete each time they step onto their competitive venue. ‐ Create Competition‐Like Scenarios In Practice: make practices feel like competitions so athletes have the opportunity to challenge themselves in higher pressure/stress situations. Athletes cannot perform consistently in games if they do not practice competing in similar situations. ‐ Have Consistent Emotions: work with your athletes to identify the emotions they associate most strongly with ideal/peak performances and then help athletes learn to regulate these emotions so they can readily access them for practices and competitions. Pre‐performance routines are one effective strategy for achieving this. At the Center for Sport Psychology and Performance Excellence at the University of North Texas, we have a staff of sport consultants who are committed to helping your coaches and players perform consistently in practice and competition.

Baen Ph.D., University of North Texas Oil and gas drilling and production have increased greatly throughout the U.S. due to higher oil and gas prices as well as improvement in technologies that are both economic and reduce negative impacts to the surface estate. The Barnett Shale gas field has become the largest and most productive in Texas over a four year period with 3,800 wells being completed; however, the gas field is located in the DFW Metropolitan area, which is one of the fastest growing real estate markets in the United States. The cost-benefit analysis of urban/suburban drilling from the standpoint of land use efficiencies, economic impact, environmental impact and property taxes is considered. The paper concludes that variable long-term financial and environmental benefits to communities, surface owners, mineral/royalty owners and oil companies far exceed the direct and indirect costs of gas wells that are professionally planned and operated. Key words/concepts: oil and gas valuation methods, need for education by real estate related professionals, planners and city administrators, city drilling ordinances, land-use efficiencies. *This is a draft. **Please do not publish any part of this manuscript without prior approval of author (office phone 940-565-3071 or baen@unt.edu.) ****************************************************************************************************	NA

Spicer1,* and Warren W. Burggren2 1School of Biological Sciences, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, U.K. 2Department of Biological Sciences, University of North Texas, Denton, USA. Received July 31, 2002 · Revised version received December 6, 2002 · Accepted December 11, 2002 Summary There is currently tremendous interest in how the physiology of individual animals changes and develops during ontogeny. One of the key areas is the extent to which the timing and/or rate of physiological development is fixed within an individual and to what extent can it be altered. We propose that plasticity in the timing of the onset of a particular physiological regulatory system during an individuals development be referred to as physiological heterokairy (to clearly distinguish this phenomenon from physiological heterochrony, which is an evolutionary pattern), and we marshal evidence for three different patterns of heterokairy: 1. altering relative position in the physiological itinerary; 2. altering overall rate of development per se and; 3. a combination of 1 and 2. Using these patterns as a starting point, we develop a framework for investigating physiological heterokairy which takes cognizance of the facts that multiple compo- nents of each regulatory system could appear at different times and multiple regulatory systems could come ‘on-line’ at different times. We finish by placing physiological heterokairy in the wider context of its ecological and evolutionary implications and its relationship to physiological genomics and heterochrony. Key words: ontogeny, physiological development, heterochrony, physiological genomics Introduction The study of animal development has a rich history. Ar- guably, the basic morphological patterns expressed dur- ing ontogeny were more or less catalogued, at least for representatives of the major animal groups, by the be- ginning of the 20th century (Gilbert, 1985). However, over the last thirty years the explosion in our knowl- edge of molecular biology, and the application of a more rigorous evolutionary biology to studies in devel- opment, have informed and also invigorated classical embryology, evolutionary developmental biology is currently a key area of investigation in the life sciences (Hall, 1999; Holland, 1999; Arthur, 2002). Notwithstanding the recent ‘rediscovery’ of develop- mental biology, our understanding of how physiologi- cal regulatory systems appear and change during devel- opment (in different animal groups) lags far behind. In a monograph largely overlooked by contemporary de- velopmental physiologists, Adolph (1968) claimed that “The ontogeny of physiological regulations received no formal study before the twentieth century”. His mono- graph represented a major step in redressing this paucity of data and, perhaps more importantly, pro- vided fellow-workers with a detailed list of key ques- tions signposting how integrated and coherent studies of physiological development should progress. Despite the explosive growth in interest in the physio- logical development of a number of different animal groups over the past decade, and the existence of Adolph’s (1968) book, a framework within which to in- vestigate patterns of physiological development has not yet been explicitly enunciated. Current work in both ver- tebrates and invertebrates is largely defined by the physi- ological system of interest and the species (or group) in which it is studied.

Their purpose: to discuss the future of their field. Nearly four decades past the first Earth Day and the first philosophic discussions concerning our relationship to the Earth, environmental philosophy finds itself at a crossroads. While the field has made real progress over the last generation—and the environ- mental challenges we face have only grown in importance—environmen- tal philosophy has struggled to find a real home and ready audience. On the one hand, despite its decades-long effort to construct a sound theoret- ical foundation, the field still lacks academic bona fides within the larger discipline of philosophy. For some within philosophy, environmental phi- losophy does not qualify as “real” philosophy: it is too topical, insuffi- ciently theoretical in its deliberations, and tainted by an impulse toward advocacy. On the other hand, within the larger worlds of environmental science, engineering, and public policy, environmental philosophers are sometimes criticized as being too abstract and too distant from real world environmental challenges. With these mixed signals in mind, the participants in this meeting came together to discuss: chino ERTS EIEN LRT ER RN ZONUT AMES PRIN LPI TPR PN Nae AR ITN TREO, tae ETHICS & THE ENVIRONMENT, 12(2) 2007 ISSN: 1085-6633 ©lndiana University Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

We have tried to present various aspects of the process of “doing” a thesis or dissertation. We hope that you will get some good ideas from this issue, whether you are actively engaged in producing a thesis or dissertation Or just involved with ongoing scholarly research. The first article, “Preparing Your Thesis or Dissertation With a Microcomputer,” Outlines the process one might go through in planning and producing such a document. There are four articles that discuss various sources for available data to aid in the research process. Two more articles discuss statistical tools to aid in data analysis. Rounding out the “Thesis and Dissertation Production” portion of the newsletter is an article from the University of Colorado at Boulder. This article, “The Digital Dissertation: A Beer Answer for the Future,” was included as a “thought piece.” Perhaps you will read it and suddenly find yourself thinking about your research and the research and publication Process in a whole new light. We hope so!

Google’s cross-language search is a model that integrates MT and CLIR technologies to help users find information on the Web that is not written in their familiar languages. This paper overviews the functions of Google’s cross-language search and its performance. It proposes strategies that digital libraries can apply for implementing multilingual information access through the discussion of the cases of five bilingual or multilingual digital libraries. Keywords: Digital Libraries, multilingual information access, Google, cross-language search Introduction Recent and continuing advances in online information systems are creating many opportunities and also new problems in information access and retrieval. Although English is the language of the Internet (Flammia & Saunders, 2007), online documents are available internationally in many different languages. This provides opportunity for users to directly access previously unavailable sources of information. Cross-language Information Access (CLIA) is the desideratum of many Web users: information can be understood and used from various Web pages in multiple languages. Researchers in various disciplines have been diligently working on exploring computing algorithms and systems. CLIA research has been vigorously pursued through TREC (http://trec.nist.gov/), CLEF (http://www.clef-campaign.org/), an Asian Language Retrieval and Question-answering Workshop called NTCIR (http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/) and other forums. Significant experimental results have been obtained in cross-language summarization workshops and cross-language named entity extraction challenges by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) and the Geographic Information Retrieval track (GeoCLEF) of CLEF (Gey et al, 2006). Many related research projects have been funded by U.S. government agencies and the governments of other countries. Exploration and application of related technologies in areas such as digital libraries are ongoing and becoming increasingly popular (Larson, Gey, & Chen, 2002; Wang, Lu, & Chien, 2004; Monroy, Furuta, & Castro, 2007). However, there is little application of these technologies in existing information access systems such as commercial online services and digital libraries. In 2004, search engines began to provide various language supports. Zhang ad Lin (2007) investigated the multiple language support features in 21 search engines. The selected search engines were categorized into regular search engines (such as Google, Yahoo, and MSN), meta-search engines (such as Exite, HotBot, and WebCrawler), and visualization search engines (Kartoo, Onlinelink, and Ujiko). Zhang and Lin summarized the characteristics and functions of these search engines in the following five aspects: the number of supported languages, visibility of language support, translation ability, result 1****************************************************************************************************	Information Access across Languages in Digital Age

As these programs evolve, forms of educational technology can help professors deliver effective instruction, develop and enhance curricula, evaluate student progress, and better manage resources. Educational technology is a discipline that combines instructional media (e.g., video recorders, cassette/microcassette recorders, videodiscs, and compact discs), computerized tools (e.g., laptops, microcomputers, and pen-based systems), and cognitive processing (e.g., in- formation processing, learning, and memory). Although use- ful and effective, computerized tools are the most reluctantly used form of educational technology. Some teacher educa- tion faculty lack either the experience, expertise, or confi- dence needed to effectively use computerized resources. Administrators can help eliminate this by providing techni- cal support (e.g., troubleshooting, configuration support, and written procedures for commonly asked technical questions), dispensing rewards and incentives for faculty who efficiently use technology in instruction, and offering professional de- velopment opportunities (e.g., workshops, seminars, and coaching). Introduction Many teachers are helping to change the face of America's educational system. Across the U.S., many classrooms are moving from teacher-centered, single-discipline, and prod- uct-oriented environments to student-centered, cross-dis- ciplinary, process-oriented learning centers. This shift has been motivated by the Information Age, which ushered mil- lions of computers into U.S. schools. Newer and more pow- erful forms of computer-based tools have become an essential part of the educational experience for many stu- dents. From the mid-to-late 1980s, the number of micro- computers used in U.S. schools increased from 50,000 to over 2,400,000 (Becker, 1991). Even though the number of microcomputers in U.S. schools is increasing rapidly, some faculty in college and university teacher education programs are still reluctant to use them. This article discusses several types of educational technologies, reasons why teachers are reluctant to use them, and ways administrators can moti- vate faculty to use technology effectively. Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) has many forms; the most common are drill and practice, tutorials, instructional lournal of Computing in Teacher Education Volume t2 Number 2 games, and simulations. Other types of educational tech- nology, like telecommunications (e.g., e-mail and Internet), applications software, and video, can benefit teachers by reducing duplication; increasing efficiency and productiv- ity; assisting in the development of interactive, technology- rich curriculum materials; and establishing and maintaining collaborative peer networks. More than thirty years of research on the effectiveness of CAI exists. In a 1988 report prepared by the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, CAI is described as an ef- fective supplement to instruction. Hundreds of studies were synthesized. The OTA report concluded that “elementary stu- dents who received brief daily CAI lessons as a supplement to instruction showed gains equivalent to 1-8 months of instruc- tion over their peers" (p.46). CAI, used as the sole instruc- tional vehicle, produced mixed results. Also reported were increases in students’ speed completing tasks, attention, and motivation. As such, teacher education faculty should acquire relevant CAI software and the hardware needed to integrate computerized lessons into their existing curricula. This would provide opportunities for faculty to develop content-specific lessons and supplemental CAI learning activities. Faculty could also build research programs that evaluate the effectiveness of these lessons and learning activities. Telecommunications enables faculty to pursue research without the limitations of location or time. Through this media, data collection and consultations with peers in dif- ferent geographical locations can take place without much difficulty. Appropriate computer networks, hardware, soft- ware protocols, and configuration issues should be in place to support this. If facilities and resources necessary are avail- able and operational, educators can participate in electronic forums, post requests for information on the Internet, com- municate using bulletin boards, and have conversations with colleagues in other countries. Educators need not travel to other locations to gain valuable information or waste money on postage. Electronic mail can serve as a means for faculty to communicate about conferences, distribute committee assignments at the local, national, and international! levels, pursue joint research projects, and prepare manuscripts. Applications software (e.g., integrated software that in- cludes database, spreadsheet. word processing, desktop publishing, and graphics capabilities) can be used as mana- gerial and instructional tools. Teacher education faculty can use this type of software to prepare communications, record ****************************************************************************************************	NA

In complement, control-theorists have recently sought to develop decentralized algorithms/controllers that bring a network’s components into agreement or consensus, i.e. that deliberately drive the states of network components to a common value that depends on the initial component states in a prescribed manner. Thus far, most studies on consensus control have been limited to the case that the agents’ open-loop internal dynamics are described by an integrator chain (e.g., single- or double-integrator models [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]). Very recently, a few researchers have begun to consider consensus control among agents with general identical linear internal dynamics, see [8, 9, 10, 11]. In this article, we address consensus control for networks whose agents have identical but arbi- trary multi-input LTI open-loop dynamics, and a quite-general observation topology. Speciﬁcally, we exploit a high-gain decentralized control scheme to obtain consensus for this general agent model, and for a broad class of network topologies. Let us brieﬂy overview the literature on consensus. We note that the consensus problem actually has a long history in the computer science community [12]. The control-theoretic approach to consensus - i.e., the use of a feedback methodology to sychronize agents’ local states in a network to a prescribed function of their initial states - is relatively new, but has been extensively studied in the control community during the last ﬁve years and has yielded some advances in e.g., sensor networking ([1, 2, 3, 4]) and autonomous vehicle control applications ([13, 5, 14, 7]).

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key signaling role in plants and are controlled in cells by a complex network of ROS metabolizing enzymes found in several different cellular compartments. To study how different ROS signals, generated in different cellular compartments, are integrated in cells, we generated a double mutant lacking thylakoid ascorbate peroxidase (tylapx) and cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase1 (apx1). Our analysis suggests that two different signals are generated in plants lacking cytosolic APX1 or tylAPX. The lack of a chloroplastic hydrogen peroxide removal enzyme triggers a speciﬁc signal in cells that results in enhanced tolerance to heat stress, whereas the lack of a cytosolic hydrogen peroxide removal enzyme triggers a different signal, which results in stunted growth and enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress. When the two signals are coactivated in cells (i.e. tylapx/apx1), a new response is detected, suggesting that the integration of the two different signals results in a new signal that manifests in late ﬂowering, low protein oxidation during light stress, and enhanced accumulation of anthocyanins. Our results demonstrate a high degree of plasticity in ROS signaling in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and suggest the existence of redundant pathways for ROS protection that compensate for the lack of classical ROS removal enzymes such as cytosolic and chloroplastic APXs. Further investigation of the enhanced heat tolerance in plants lacking tylAPX, using mutants deﬁcient in chloroplast-to-nuclei retrograde signaling, suggests the existence of a chloroplast-generated stress signal that enhances basal thermotolerance in plants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) control in-plant pro- cesses such as growth, development, stomata signal- ing, and biotic and abiotic stress responses (Torres and Dangl, 2005; Asada, 2006; Gapper and Dolan, 2006; Halliwell, 2006; Kwak et al., 2006; Mullineaux et al., 2006; Pitzschke and Hirt, 2006; Torres et al., 2006; Van Breusegem and Dat, 2006; Zaninotto et al., 2006). The steady-state level of ROS in cells, as well as the dura- tion, subcellular localization, and intensity of ROS signals, are thought to be controlled in cells by the ROS gene network (Mittler et al., 2004; Bailey-Serres and Mittler, 2006).

Although the ROS gene network of plants is thought to play a key role in the regulation of different biolog- ical processes (Bailey-Serres and Mittler, 2006), the function of fewer than 5% of the genes that compose the ROS network of Arabidopsis has been determined (Mittler et al., 2004). Moreover, the mode of coordina- tion and the degree of redundancy and cross talk between different branches of the ROS network, as well as the way in which the network senses and transduces ROS signals, are virtually unknown. The different scavenging and producing enzymes encoded by the ROS gene network are found in many different cellular compartments. In addition, usually more than one enzymatic scavenging activity per a speciﬁc ROS can be found in each of the different compartments (Mittler, 2002; Mittler et al., 2004).

Accounts for each raptor species in Torres del Paine are provided, including information on weight, habitat, diet, residence, conservation, and miscellaneous observations in the Park. We compare raptor species richness in Torres del Paine with well studied localities in central and northern Chile, and speculate on causes for the higher raptor diversity observed in the Park. Raptor macroniches in Torres del Paine are assessed, describing primarily their use of two major habitat types and nine food resources. We examine food-niche relationships for a subset of four mammal-eating raptors, in light of their different ecologies and body sizes. A monitoring program for raptors in Torres del Paine is proposed, under the rationale that these indicator species may help foresee impending disruptions of basic ecosystem processes that determine the relatively pristine conditions still prevailing in the Park. Key words: Falconiformes, Strigiformes, Chile, Patagonia, diet, weight, habitat use, niche relationships. RESUMEN Quince especies de rapaces (Falconiformes y Strigiformes) se reproducen y otras dos posiblemente se reproducen en el Parque Nacional Torres del Paine (Patagonia chilena), la mayor riqueza de especies de rapaces documentada hasta ahora en Chile. Entregamos descripciones de cada especie de rapaz en Torres del Paine, incluyendo información sobre peso, hábitat, dieta, residencia, conservación, y observaciones misceláneas en el Parque. Comparamos la riqueza de especies de rapaces en Torres del Paine con aquella en localidades bien estudiadas del centro y norte de Chile, y especulamos sobre las causas de la mayor diversidad de rapaces observadas en el Parque. Determinamos los macronichos de las rapaces en Torres del Paine, describiendo principalmente su uso de dos tipos de hábitats predominantes y de nueve tipos de recursos alimentarios. Examinamos las relaciones de nicho trófico en un conjunto de cuatro rapaces consumidoras de micromamíferos, a la luz de sus diferentes ecologías y tamaños corporales. Esbozamos un programa de monitoreo para las rapaces de Torres del Paine, bajo el criterio que estas especies indicadoras pueden ayudar a prever posibles disfunciones de los procesos ecosistémicos básicos que determinan las condiciones relativamente prístinas aún prevalentes en el Parque. Palabras clave: Falconiformes, Strigiformes, Chile, Patagonia, dieta, peso, uso del hábitat, relaciones de nicho. INTRODUCTION Raptors are at the end of a series of energy trans- fers along food chains, from the primary producers up to several organisms that prey on each other. Being a top predator does not guarantee an easy existence. The likelihood that raptors will become prey of other predators is low, but their prey is not easy to catch. Those that are easily caught may be weakened by parasites, diseases, and toxins that may in turn decrease the raptors’ fitness (that is, their survival compounded by reproductive suc- cess). Raptors are indeed a sink into which all ailments of an ecosystem pour, sooner or later. If poison is applied to control “vermin species,” such as rabbits or hares, it may be ingested and may eventually kill a raptor that was contributing to keeping the vermin’s population in check, thus****************************************************************************************************	MARZO 2002

RESEARCH BRiEF # 12 Family Contexts of Young Dual Language Learners: A Review of Language and Literacy Practices !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! Introduction During the past several decades, the United States has undergone a demographic transformation that has changed the nation’s race-ethnic composition (Suárez- Orozco & Páez, 2008). Our current demographic reality is shaped by families from diverse ethnicities and countries of origin including descendants and immigrants from Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia and Africa (Hernandez, Denton & Macartney, 2008). There is enormous diversity in the families of DLLs as not only they come from different ethnic groups and countries of origin, but also they bring a diversity of values, beliefs, and practices, as well as resources. But beyond demographics, what else do we know about families with children who are DLLs and how do these family contexts influence the language and literacy development of young DLLs? The purpose of this comprehensive review is to synthesize and describe existing research literature on the language and literacy practices of families of dual language learners (DLLs), and on how these practices might DLLs language and literacy development. For young DLLs the role of the family context is complex and involves characteristics such as socio-demographic factors as well as family processes that are unique to the immigrant experience or to the experience of speaking a language other than the majority language at home and their communities. Of particular importance is the linguistic and literacy environment of DLLs since it can have implications for the school readiness of this population. This critical review includes peer-reviewed articles from 2001-2011 with a focus on families of dual language learners defined as children from birth through 5 years of age who are learning a second language while continuing to acquire their first language. Twenty- eight studies met review criteria and were reviewed and analyzed. Results 1. The review revealed two research paradigms in the current research –studies that focus on describing the family context of DLLs children, and studies that focus on examining the impact of the family context on child outcomes. The studies that described the family context focused on family activities related to language and literacy such as book reading and reading in general, language use and exposure, narrative and storytelling, teaching practices, general literacy teaching practices in the home, home literacy environment and writing activities. Those studies that examined the role of the family context on child outcomes focused on measures of language development (oral language, vocabulary, phonological awareness) and/ or DLLs literacy skills (reading, shared book reading, writing). 2. The studies reviewed identified variables such as generational status, intermarriage, sequential or simultaneous learning of L2, parental educational level, and a variety of literacy practices, as important aspects of !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !****************************************************************************************************	Research brief 12-Family Context-final.pdf

González Abstract—As vehicle manufacturers continue to increase their emphasis on safety with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs), we propose a device that is not only already in abundance but portable enough as well to be one of the most effective multipurpose devices that are able to analyze and advise on safety conditions. Mobile smartphones today are equipped with numerous sensors that can help to aid in safety enhancements for drivers on the road. In this paper, we use the three-axis accelerometer of an Android-based smartphone to record and analyze various driver behaviors and external road conditions that could potentially be hazardous to the health of the driver, the neighboring public, and the automobile. Effective use of these data can educate a potentially dangerous driver on how to safely and efﬁciently operate a vehicle. With real-time analysis and auditory alerts of these factors, we can increase a driver’s overall awareness to maximize safety. Index Terms—Accelerometer, mobile phone, road conditions, sensors, vehicle safety. I. INTRODUCTION In the fast-paced society of today, we are focused on arriving at our destination as quickly as possible. However, with this lifestyle, we are not always aware of all the dangerous conditions that are experi- enced while operating an automobile. Factors such as sudden vehicle maneuvers and hazardous road conditions, which often contribute to accidents, are not always apparent to the person behind the wheel. In recent years, there has been tremendous growth in smartphones embedded with numerous sensors such as accelerometers, Global Po- sitioning Systems (GPSs), magnetometers, multiple microphones, and even cameras [1]–[3]. The scope of sensor networks has expanded into many application domains such as intelligent transportation systems that can provide users with new functionalities previously unheard of [4]. Experimental automobiles in the past have included certain sensors to record data preceding test crashes [5], [6]. After analysis, crash scenarios are stored and analyzed with real-time driving data to potentially recognize a future crash [7] and actually prevent it [8]. With more than 10 million car accidents reported in the United States each year [9], car manufacturers have shifted their focus of a passive approach, e.g., airbags, seat belts, and antilock brakes, to more active by adding features associated with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs) [10], e.g., lane departure warning system [11] and collision Manuscript received July 22, 2010; revised April 7, 2011 and November 4, 2011; accepted January 20, 2012.

However, vehicles manufactured with these sensors are hard to ﬁnd in lower priced economical vehicles as ADAS packages are not cheap add-ons. In addition, older vehicles might only have passive safety features since manufacturers only recently began to introduce an effective driver assist. Since sensors ultimately add onto the cost of a vehicle initially and cannot be affordably upgraded, we target a mobile smartphone as an alternative device for ADASs that can assist the driver and compliment any existing active safety features. Given its accessibility and portability, the smartphone can bring a driver assist to any vehicle without regard for on-vehicle communication system requirements. With this as our motivation, we envision a cheap and convenient mobile device that is able to analyze and advise the driver on sudden and harmful situations that arise from vehicle maneuvers and envi- ronmental factors. This type of driver assist is only meant to comple- ment the driver but not to take full control of the vehicle. Providing constructive feedback to the driver is crucial in correcting bad driving behaviors. Recently, Ford and BMW have proposed ideas on this type of driver assist, where it can be integrated into their telematics system, along with hundreds of other vehicles sensors [14]. Given the sensing capability of smartphones, we use the internal accelerometer and GPS of the phone in place of the expensive hardware installed in vehicles to assist active features provided in newer ADAS vehicles. This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we present the related research. Section III explains the proposed setup of the ex- periments in which we used a mobile phone as a measuring device to detect vehicle maneuvers and road conditions. In Section IV, we reveal results that were obtained from these experiments that have the potential to aid in driver assist. We demonstrate that both extreme driving behavior and hazardous road anomalies can be identiﬁed using a mobile phone rather than expensive motion equipment and can aid existing safety features to increase driver awareness. We conclude the paper in Section V describing our accomplishments. II. RELATED WORK Analysis of external sensors data for vehicle performance is a large area of study. Some work has been done in the form of theoretical research and development in a practical design. The main ideas of our work focus on mapping anomalies of a road’s surface and classifying different driving behaviors. There has been some work in the ﬁeld of road analysis, speciﬁcally road anomaly detection. Nericell [1] is a system researched and de- veloped by Microsoft that detects trafﬁc honking, bumps, and vehicle braking using external sensors. For detection, it uses multiple external sensors such as a microphone, GPS, accelerometer, and Global System for Mobile communications radio for trafﬁc localization. Pothole Patrol [15] is another system that monitors road conditions using GPS and an external accelerometer. The system was deployed for testing in taxis using a convenient method to identify fatigued surfaces of a road. Tracking and analyzing driving behavior is an ongoing ITS study. University of California Berkeley’s Mobile Millennium project is a trafﬁc-monitoring system that uses GPS data to obtain individual vehicle location information, process it, and distribute route informa- tion back to a mobile phone [4].

[16] describe an infrastructure that can be used to distribute driver and vehicle information utilizing popular characteristics associated 1524-9050/$31.00 © 2012 IEEE****************************************************************************************************	NA

It is a complex phe- nomenon that interacts with many other aspects of language. Besides the direct meaning, negated statements often carry a latent positive meaning. Negation can be interpreted in terms of its scope and focus. This paper explores the importance of both scope and focus to capture the meaning of negated statements. Some issues on detecting negation from text are outlined, the forms in which negation occurs are depicted and heuristics to detect its scope and focus are proposed. Introduction Capturing the semantics of text is a long term goal in the natural language processing community. Whereas philoso- phers and linguists have proposed several theories, along with models to represent the meaning of text, the ﬁeld of computational linguistics is still far from doing so automat- ically. The ambiguity of natural language, the need to de- tect implicit knowledge, and the demand for commonsense knowledge and reasoning are only a few of the difﬁculties to overcome to understand text. We must say that signiﬁcant progress has been made, especially on detection of semantic relations, ontologies and reasoning methods. Negation is present in all languages and it is always the case that statements are afﬁrmative by default. Nega- tion is marked and it typically signals something unusual It may be present in all units of lan- or an exception. guage, e.g., words (incredible), clauses (He doesn’t have friends). Negation and its correlates (truth values, lying, irony, false or contradictory statements) are deﬁning and exclusive characteristics of the human species (Horn 1989; Horn and Kato 2000). Simply put, negation is a process that turns parts of a statement into its opposite. Negation is fairly well-understood and described in gram- mars; the valid ways to express a negation are formulated and documented. However, there has not been much work on automatically detecting it, or more importantly, on repre- senting the semantics of negations from natural language. At ﬁrst glance, negation might seem easy to deal with. One might think that the problem could be reduced to ﬁnd Copyright c(cid:2) 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. negative polarity items, determine their scope and reverse its polarity. Actually, it is much more problematic. Negation plays a remarkable role towards understanding text and poses considerable challenges. Negation interacts with many other phenomena and it is used for so many dif- ferent purposes that a deep analysis is needed. The following are some issues found when dealing with negation. Detecting the scope of negation in itself is challenging: All vegetarians do not eat meat means that vegetarians do not eat meat and yet All that glitters is not gold means that it is not the case that all that glitters is gold (so out of all things that glitter, some are gold and some are not). In the former example, the universal quantiﬁer all has scope over the negation; in the latter, the negation has scope over all. In logic, two negatives always cancel each other out. On the other hand, in language that is only theoretically the case: she is not unhappy does not mean that she is happy; it means that she is not fully unhappy, but she is not happy either. Some negated statements carry a positive implicit mean- ing. For example, cows do not eat meat implies that cows eat something other than meat. Otherwise, the speaker would have stated cows do not eat. A clearer example is the cor- rect and yet puzzling statement tables do not eat meat. The sentence sounds unnatural because the underlying positive statement (i.e., tables eat something other than meat) con- tradicts the fact that tables do not eat. Negation can express less than or in between when used in a scalar context. For example, John does not have three chil- dren probably means that he has either one or two children. Contrasts may use negation to disagree about a statement and not to negate it. For example, That truck is not big, it is massive deﬁnes the truck as massive, and therefore, big. In this paper, we investigate the signiﬁcance of negation in semantic representation of natural language. We illus- trate the importance of detecting both its scope and focus and propose a semantic representation that beneﬁts from fo- cus detection. Related Work Negation has been widely studied outside of computational linguistics. In logic, it is usually the simplest unary operator and it reverses the truth value. The seminal work on negation by Horn (1989) presents the main thoughts in philosophy and psychology. We follow him in the next two paragraphs. 228****************************************************************************************************	Some Issues on Detecting Negation from Text

Pristine wilderness is a scarce global resource, but exotic species are so common that they constitute a principal component of worldwide ecological change. The relationship between these two topics, invasion and remoteness, was the impetus behind ﬁve years of ﬁeldwork aimed at identifying the assemblage and range of exotic vertebrates in Cape Horn, Chile, identiﬁed as one of the world’s most pristine wilderness areas. While the archipelago has extremely low human population density and vast tracts of undisturbed land, we discovered that several ter- restrial vertebrate groups were dominated by exotic species. Native birds were diverse (approx. 154 spp), and only 1.3% (or two spp.) were introduced. In contrast, exotic terrestrial mammals (12 spp.) and freshwater ﬁsh (three spp.) outnumbered their native counterparts, constituting 55% and 75% of the assemblages. Using GIS, we found that not all areas were impacted equally, largely due to intensity of human occupation. Human settled islands (Navarino and Tierra del Fuego) hosted the greatest number of exotics, but humans alone did not explain observed pat- terns. Remote islands also had introduced species. North American beavers (Castor canadensis), American minks (Mustela vison) and feral domestic dogs and cats were particularly widespread, and their range in isolated parts of the study area raised important ecological and management questions. In conclusion, the Cape Horn Archipelago retained areas free of exotic vertebrates, particularly parts of the Cape Horn and Alberto D’Agostini National Parks, but at many sites introduced species were overwhelming native biota and altering these previously remote natural ecosystems.

You will acquire basic knowledge about specific music traditions and will learn to write critically about music as an aspect of culture and society. The study of music from a cultural perspective illustrates the important role of music as a means of expression grounded in religious, political, social, and cultural identity. The course will cover a wide range of music traditions from various parts of the world including Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Occasional guest musicians will give lecture/demonstrations in class to help you better understand a particular musical tradition. Required Materials Worlds of Music: An Introduction to the Music of the World's Peoples (5th Edition), edited by Jeff Titon, published by Cengage Learning.

1250	TRXXJZWN3BBOHZHXNU2JNRZ6DQKUOWY3	2.NotForRepo	Functions Functions and Modeling A UTeach/TNT Course Deﬁnition of a Function DEFINITION: Let A and B be sets. A function between A and B is a subset of A × B with the property that if (a, b1) and (a, b2) are both in the subset, then b1 = b2. The domain of the function is the set of all ﬁrst coordinates in the set and the range is the set of all second coordinates in the set. The set B is sometimes called the codomain. If it happens that the domain of f is equal to all of A, then we say that f is a function from A to B and we write f : A → B. Types of Functional Relationships DEFINITION: A function is called surjective (or is said to map A onto B) if B = range f . The question of whether or not a function is surjective depends on the choice of the set B. A function can always be made surjective by restricting the codomain to being equal to the range although this is not always convenient. DEFINITION: A function is called injective (or one-to-one) if it satisﬁes the property that for all a, a(cid:3) ∈ A, if f (a) = f (a(cid:3)), then a = a(cid:3). If a function is both surjective and injective, then it is particularly well be- haved. DEFINITION: A function f : A → B is called bijective if it is both surjective and injective.****************************************************************************************************	H:\Mytex\class\2100\functions.DVI

The academic adviser will assist the student in developing a formal degree plan by the end of the student’s second term/semester in the program. Minors The rehabilitation counseling curriculum does not usually include a minor, but some students may be able to select a minor. Program Accreditation and Professional Certification/Licensing The graduate curriculum in rehabilitation counseling has been designed to satisfy the accreditation standards established by the Council on Rehabilitation Educa- tion (CORE) [1835 Rohlwing Road, Suite E, Rolling Meadows, IL 60008; (847) 394-1785]. The DRSWA rehabilitation counseling program is fully accredited by CORE. Students completing the rehabilitation counsel- ing program are eligible to take the examination for national certification as a rehabilitation counselor (CRC). By taking selected course work within the electives, students can complete academic require- ments for one of three other professional credentials. Rehabilitation counseling students may be eligible for licensure as a professional counselor by the Texas State Board of Examiners of Professional Counsel- ors (LPC). Students seeking the LPC are required to complete 3,000 hours of supervised practice and must successfully pass the state licensing examination. Students may also complete academic requirements of the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse for licensure as a Chemical Depen- dency Counselor (LCDC). The LCDC requires 4,000 hours of approved supervised work experience and successful completion of a state examination. Finally, students may qualify to take the certification exami- nation of the Biofeedback Certification Institute of America (BCIA) to qualify as a neurofeedback therapist (BCIA-EEG). Financial Assistance The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) of the U.S. Department of Education often provides financial support to graduate students in rehabilitation to increase the number of qualified professionals in various rehabilitation counseling occupations. DRSWA occasionally is able to pro- vide RSA stipend assistance to qualified students to support their graduate studies in rehabilitation counseling. The availability of federal stipend sup- port varies from year to year. Inquiries should be made at the time of application to the rehabilitation graduate program.

1800	FJT7GFYC252DU6364RCVW7YGPDDRVMW5	2.NotForRepo	Guest Speaker Friday, June 26, 2015 at 11:30am, NTDP F223 Learning Probabilistic Scripts for Text Understanding Dr. Ray Mooney Abstract In natural language processing, scripts encode knowledge of stereotypical event sequences encountered in text and can be used to improve text comprehension and draw inferences that are naturally made by human readers. Schank introduced the idea of scripts in the 1970's as a form of non-probabilistic knowledge; however, Chambers and Jurafsky (2008) and other recent work has attempted to learn probabilistic script models from large corpora of raw text. We have recently developed two improved statistical script induction methods, the first extends previous single verb-argument models to multiple verb arguments; and the second utilizes Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (which have recently demonstrated impressive performance on machine translation and image description). We evaluate these new models using Chambers and Jurafsky's "narrative cloze" task in which an event (represented as a verb and its arguments) is deleted, and the system must correctly infer it from the other events in the document. Our new script models demonstrate significantly improved performance on this evaluation compared to previous methods. Bio Raymond J. Mooney is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. He received his Ph.D. in 1988 from the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign. He is an author of over 150 published research papers, primarily in the areas of machine learning and natural language processing. He was the President of the International Machine Learning Society from 2008-2011, program co-chair for AAAI 2006, general chair for HLT-EMNLP 2005, and co-chair for ICML 1990. He is a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, the Association for Computing Machinery, and the Association for Computational Linguistics and the recipient of best paper awards from AAAI-96, KDD-04, ICML-05 and ACL-07.****************************************************************************************************	NA

1210	HB6HNFFVC7YZRFTRC5XTNTFT46X6LNLB	2.NotForRepo	Beginning/Class Composition I (MUCP1180/3080) Dr. Joseph Klein 08/29/12 COMPOSITION PROJECT #3 (melodic variations) 1. Composition—Using the original melody from project #2 as a model, create a set of five variations for a solo monophonic instrument of your choosing (preferably selected from the list of instruments represented in class). Each of these variations will utilize one of the following pitch systems: a. modal (choose one: dorian, phrygian, lydian, mixolydian, locrian) b. pentatonic (anhemitonic—i.e. “black key”—variety) c. whole-tone d. octatonic e. a scale or mode of your own design (explain in the attached analysis) 2. Pre-compositional work—On a sheet of manuscript paper, sketch out a transcription of the original melody for each of the pitch environments listed above. Once you have done this, you may then develop your variations by applying the following processes: a. ornamentation (neighbor tones, trills, pitch bends, etc.) b. rhythmic alterations (including augmentation/diminution) c. change in tempo d. contrasts in musical “character” (resulting from a combination of other factors) These changes should be explored freely, but not to the degree of sacrificing the essential qualities of the original melody—this is the very basis of variation technique. 3. Keeping in mind that the primary purpose of this project is to explore the melodic possibilities inherent to each distinct scale/mode, you must strictly adhere to the given pitch environment within each variation; play or sing the melodies after you have composed them to ensure that they clearly establish the unique sound quality of each scale/mode. Do not attempt to “modulate” or incorporate pitches outside of the collection, as this will only obscure the distinctive sound quality of each. 4. Because these melodies are to be composed for a specific instrument, issues such as range, technical limitations (e.g., register breaks, string changes, fingerings), dynamic characteristics, etc. must be taken into consideration. A “cheat sheet” of instrumental/vocal ranges may be downloaded from the course website. If you are composing the work for an instrument other than your own, you are expected to consult an experienced performer of the given instrument for guidance. 5. Once you have worked out each of the variations, make a final copy of the collection, beginning each variation on a new system. On the staff above each variation, write out the pitches of the scale/mode that you are using and label it with the correct name. Make sure that the melody in each variation uses only those pitches indicated! 6. Analysis/commentary—In the attached analysis, discuss how each of the five variations compares with the original, considering the following questions: a. How does the quality of the melody change with each new pitch environment? b. What are the inherent strengths and weaknesses of each scale/mode? c. What alterations did you make to the original melody in order to enhance the distinct characteristics of each scale/mode? • Be prepared to discuss the project in class on Friday, September 28 and to read the works in class on Friday, October 5. • The project (including commentary and pre-compositional sketches) and a copy of the original melody are due in class on Wednesday, October 10.****************************************************************************************************	1180-3080_project3_F12

Out of these various conflicts - religious, political, and cultural - emerged a transformed Europe. The ideas that began to develop during the Renaissance gave birth to that which the early humanists called the "modern," but not in the way that many of them envisioned at the time. Upon this political and cultural foundation would be built absolutism, the Enlightenment, and everything else that we have come to know as "Europe." It is hoped that this course will provide the student with a better understanding of this important and formative period of Western Civilization. Course Requirements and Grading Policies: Students will take two (2) major exams. In addition, they will write a 5-page and a 10-page paper. All will be graded on a strict 100-point scale. The final will NOT be comprehensive. The grades will be assigned as follows: A = 90 - 100 points B = 80 - 89 points C = 70 - 79 points D = 60 - 69 points F = 59 and below Exams, and Papers (percentage of grade) 5-page Paper Due (20%) Midterm (25%) 10-page Paper Due (30%) Final (25%) Wednesday, March 4 Wednesday, March 11 Wednesday, April 8 Wednesday, May 13 (1:30 – 3:30 pm) Lectures and Readings: 21 Jan. 26 & 28 Jan. 2 & 4 Feb. 9 & 11 Feb. 16 & 18 Feb. 23, 25 Feb. & 2 March 4 & 9 March Introduction to the Reformation Early 16th-century Social and Religious Conditions Luther and Lutheranism Zwingli, Anabaptists and Other Groups Calvin and Calvinism English Reformation to 1558 Lindberg chpt 1 Lindberg chpt 2 Lindberg chpts 3, 4, 5 Lindberg chpts 6, 7, 8, 9 Lindberg chpt 10 Lindberg chpt 13, pp. 293-310 Catholic Reformation and Counter-Reformation Lindberg chpt 14 11 March MIDTERM 23 & 25 March 30 March & 1, 6 April 8, 13 15 April France 1559-1598 Spain Under Philip II Elizabethan England 20 April Economic and Social Issues 1 Lindberg chpt 11 Lindberg chpts 12, 14 Lindberg chpt 13 pp. 310-320****************************************************************************************************	10 am Class Syllabus

We introduce elementary mathematical logic, sets, functions, and relations, and we study different methods of mathematical proof with a strong emphasis on mathematical induction. In addition, we use these methods to prove some theorems in number theory, one of the most beautiful areas of mathematics! Prerequisites for Math 2000: Math 1650. Textbook: Title: Discrete Mathematics, Brief Edition Authors: Susanna S. Epp Publisher: Cengage Learning Homework: I will assign homework on Mondays (see http://www.math.unt.edu/~richter/teach/F16-2000-2-due), and the assignments are usually due the following Monday at the beginning of class. Late homework will NOT be accepted for any reason. Your lowest homework score will be dropped (This includes work you miss due to illness, family emergency, transportation problems, oversleeping, work schedule, completing the wrong section, completing the wrong problems, etc.). Special Projects: Fibonacci Numbers in Nature: The assignment will be given out in class in October, and it will be due a week later. Solution Guide: Meet with an assigned small group of Math 2000 students and write a polished and detailed solution guide to one homework assignment. The small group must debate choices of word and notation, as well as choice of correct proof to include based on aesthetic taste. The solution guide will be copied and distributed to the whole class. The class may then discuss choices of notation, proof techniques, and creative insights presented in the guide. Questionnaires: Fill out a short questionnaire after receiving each solution guide. Students will be asked to judge if the solution guide prepared by peers provided effective and well-crafted mathematical communication. Exams & Grading Policy: Your final grade will be based on homework, special projects, two midterms, and a comprehensive final. The midterms will be on Oct 5th and on Nov 9th. The final exam will be on Dec 12th. Please make sure that you are available at those dates, since there will be NO make up exams! The grade is comprised of Homework (16%), Fibonacci Numbers Project (4%) Solution Guide (8%) Questionnares (8%) 2 Midterms (32%) Comprehensive Final (32%). You are encouraged to study together and help each other throughout the semester. If everyone does well, everyone will receive a good grade.****************************************************************************************************	Syllabus for MATH 2000 (Fall 2016)

Prerequisite: at least 12 hours of Biology credit or consent of instructor Course information on Blackboard: http://ecampus.unt.edu/webct/entryPage.dowebct Organization and requirements: This course will offer an introductory survey of the biology, ecology and behavior of birds (Class Aves), with special emphasis on those attributes that are unique to birds. Birds represent a diverse group of >10,000 known biological species. Lecture topics include the origin of birds, their adaptations for different lifestyles, their individual and social behavior, migration, breeding biology, and their conservation. This course will complement concepts learned in Ecology, Evolution, Physiology, Animal Behavior, and Conservation. Optional field trips will be arranged to local birding spots throughout the semester. This is an upper level course for both undergraduate-­‐ and graduate-­‐level students. A separate lab course is offered to complement the lecture course. The lab will focus on bird identification (sight & song) and field research. Students are required to attend all fieldtrips. • Fieldtrips will include local hotspots and a weekend trip in April (camping equipment required). We will provide updates on the fieldtrips as the semester progresses. Personal binoculars and a field guide are required. A limited number of basic binoculars are available for borrow… but arrange ASAP if necessary.****************************************************************************************************	Microsoft Word - Ornithology_syllabus_2016.docx

Teaching Assistant: David McRae Email: DavidMcrae@my.unt.edu Office: Chilton Hall 330 Office Hours: T 1-3 PM Course Description This course is devoted to the study of the supernatural as a social and cultural phenomenon: how the practices and beliefs that we often term religion are lived out and practiced among groups of human beings, and how they affect other aspects of human life, from kinship to politics to how we obtain food. As the vast majority of humanity affiliates with religion on some level, an understanding of the diversity, forms, and impacts of religion is a vital element of a thorough education for anyone seeking to understand or work with human beings. In this course, we take an anthropological approach toward understanding religion. Rather than solely a survey of the largest religions, we will cover both extremely large and extremely small religions. We will explore rituals and texts of organized religions but, additionally, practices such as magic and witchcraft which also constitute important elements in the tapestry of human religiosity. In fact, we will cover supernatural practices from every inhabited continent. In doing so, we will take a topical approach, exploring such topics as ritual, worldview, and magic using examples from many cultures, exploring both the similarities and differences in what it means to be religious and what it means to be human. 1 http://thecripplegate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Religion.jpg****************************************************************************************************	NA

The standard mathematical rounding procedure will apply to ﬁnal grades. For example, 89.4 is a B, 89.5 is an A (see Table 2).

You are allowed two unexcused absences without penalty. For the third unexcused absence, 2.5 points are deducted from your ﬁnal point total. For the fourth unexcused ab- sence, another 2.5 points are deducted. If you miss ﬁve or more classes, you must drop the class or your ﬁnal grade will be F. I expect you to arrive on time and to stay for the entire class. If you need to leave early, speak with me before class. The only excused absences I will accept are absences caused by: 1. university-sponsored activities, such as ensemble tours, which you must document in writing; 2. extended serious illness requiring a doctor’s care, which you must document in writing. Ordinary “not feeling well” does not count as extended serious illness. For that you can use one of the unexcused absences. 1****************************************************************************************************	NA

It is the study of meaning, of the principles underlying conduct, thought and knowledge. The skills it hones are the ability to analyze, to question orthodoxies and to express things clearly. However arcane some philo- sophical texts may be … the ability to formulate questions and follow arguments is the essence of education…. Philosophy is, in commercial jargon, the ultimate “transferable work skill.” — The Times, London, August 15, 1998 The study of philosophy has always been an important component of higher learning. Indeed, in the early Greek proto-universities, the Academy of Plato and the Lyceum of Aristotle, philosophy was the very foundation of all study. In the history of the European universities, from the 13th century to the present, philosophy has retained a significant place in the curriculum, even when challenged by advo- cates of religion, belles lettres, science or business. It has been studied as an end in itself, in its relation to Philosophy and Religion Studies 197 other areas and as a preparation for studies in law, theology and medicine. Philosophy develops finely honed analytic skills and problem solving abilities that are extremely use- ful in almost any academic or scientific field and in a variety of professional careers, such as journalism, public health, criminal justice and the legal profes- sions. It provides insight into our cultural heritage, through courses in the history of philosophy and comparative philosophy, and critical insight into many other fields in the humanities and the sci- ences, through such courses as philosophy of natural science, philosophy of social and behavioral science, theory of knowledge, and logic. At the undergraduate level, the Department of Philosophy and Religion Studies provides a traditional program emphasizing the history of philosophy. It seeks to teach the student methods of thinking about the comprehensive themes of truth, beauty, goodness and wisdom, conclusions concern- ing which can be used in the classroom as well as in life situations. In addition, it provides an inter- disciplinary minor in religion studies for students interested in seminary study or graduate studies in religion. The major emphases of the department at the graduate level are research and instruction in environmental ethics and environmental philosophy. It is the leading program in this area nationally and internationally. The department collaborates with the Department of Biological Sciences in the gradu- ate environmental science program. Programs of Study The department offers undergraduate and gradu- ate programs in the following areas: • Bachelor of Arts, • Master of Arts, and • Doctor of Philosophy, all with a major in philosophy. Bachelor of Arts Degree Requirements 1. Hours Required and General/College Require- ments: A minimum of 128 semester hours, of which 42 must be advanced, and fulfillment of degree requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree as specified in the “General University Requirements” in the Academics section of this catalog and the Col- lege of Arts and Sciences requirements. 2.

What types of plants are there on the Earth? Are plants vital for life on Earth? What are the parts of a plant? How do plants meet their needs to survive? Unit Summary This is a unit on plants. It focuses on how plants stay alive, what they contribute to the Earth and living things, and which types of environments different plants can live in. Students will work in groups using the internet to browse for different types of plants. They will print off these different kinds of plants. Each student will present on the plant they picked. Afterward, a book will be read called Plant Parts by Amy Jo. After the presentations, each child will receive a flower and take apart the different parts. They will tape them to a paper and have arrows which label each part. Two plants will be brought in, one will have survived and the other did not. The students will then discuss in pairs what happened and why. Afterward, students will individually answer the questions on the handout.

Leaders of the winning party often interpret the results of the Presidential election as the people’s mandate for one set of policies or another, while the defeated downplay the election’s signiﬁcance. Who should we believe? What goes into the selection of the only elected ofﬁcial who is responsible to the entire electorate? This course starts with the theories of voting in Presidential elections. Attention is, then, devoted to such topics as candidate strategy, voter mobilization and participation, voter information, the media’s role in the Presidential election process, and the nomination process. The goal of this course is to examine the inputs of the Presidential selection process and use knowledge of these inputs to evaluate how voters make decisions and as a starting point for evaluating how well our system selects good leaders. The following book is required for the course: 1. Abramson, Paul R., John H. Aldrich, Brad Gomez, and David W. Rohde. 2011. Change and Continuity in the 2012 and 2014 Elections. CQ Press. ISBN 1506305873 Other readings will be available either on Blackboard or in e-journals available through the library web-site (http://www.library.unt.edu). Grades and Extra Credit In this course, students are responsible for keeping up with all reading on the syllabus. There will be a midterm exam that is worth 25% of your grade and a comprehensive ﬁnal examination at the conclusion of the course that is worth 40% of the ﬁnal grade. Please come prepared to write exams with blue book(s) and a pen. ALSO NOTE, THERE WILL BE NO MAKEUP EXAMS OR INCOMPLETES GRANTED WITHOUT AN EXCUSE FROM YOUR DEAN. The remainder of your grade (35%) will be based upon a two-person group project where you will create an advertising proposal for one of the candidates. You should not expect extra credit. If I do offer extra credit, it is only when I can make it available to everyone in the class and when it furthers some educational goal that complements the goals of the course curriculum. I will not offer it as a “do-over” to students who have not completed their work satisfactorily. If you need a particular grade to graduate, maintain a particular GPA, etc. make sure you are putting in the effort to get that grade. If problems arise, address them early before they become unresolvable. Grades will be posted on Blackboard in a timely fashion. In the event of discrepancies with those grade records, discrepancies must be resolved within two weeks of their posting and students must be able to produce their assignments and exams. So, for example, challenges to recorded grades from assignments in October will not be entertained at the end of the semester. So be sure to pick up and save your assignments and tests. If I do not have a record of your taking an exam or doing an assignment and you cannot produce the evidence that you did the work, your grade on that exam or assignment will be 0. Finally, keeping apprised of your standing with respect to your grades is your responsibility. Use the percentages above to calculate a rough estimate of your current grade. The TA and I will not calculate your overall grade during the semester. Classroom Policies With respect to classroom policies, I assume that you are adults who are either capable of making your own decisions regarding your best interests or at the time when you need to start learning how to make such decisions. I also assume that most, if not all, of you are in college to prepare yourself in some way for professional life beyond college. As such, you should ask yourself whether your actions in this class are preparing you to conduct yourself successfully in that life. Attendance is not required, but as I indicated above, missing class will create signiﬁcant problems for you. Whether or not you attend lecture is your decision. You are solely responsible for any consequences of missing 1****************************************************************************************************

These diseases were very imperfectly under tood by the ancients, though you will find t~y thought and wrote much on the sub their ject. Their views were crude, because their pathology was false; treatment was empirical, because it had no fixed scientific basis. Con the few ele sidering, however , the condition of science at ments for the successful pursuit of truth, and the extremely limited means of diagnosis, we cannot but express surprise that the old school men should have accomplished as much as they did on the subject of If they have given us but little that modern science uterine affections. will recognize as correct in pathology and therapeutics with regard to these disorders, they have at least evinced a laudable spirit, in the ab sence of correct principles, for philosophical deduction. Hippocrates himself devoted, in his medical writings, two entire books to the consid eration of the diseases of females. It is, however, to be borne in mind that the father of medicine, with all the importance he attached to the diseases of women, inculcated, and indeed exacted, the fulfillment of a maxim, which must of necessity have proved a barrier to solid advancement in the accurate knowledge of these maladies. The physician, he remarked, should depend upon the testimony of some capable woman, who, after subjecting the patient to an examination per vaginam, could give the result of this ex amination to the medical man, who would then be able upon this testi mony to base a rational and curative treatment!

You observe that the IP layer stamps an identification number sequentially on each IP packet. The identification number of the first IP packet generated by a host is a random number, and the identification numbers of the subsequent IP packets are sequentially assigned. Assume all IP packets generated by hosts behind the NAT are sent to the outside world. a. Based on this observation, and assuming you can sniff all packets sent by the NAT to the outside, can you outline a simple technique that detects the number of unique hosts behind a NAT? Justify your answer. b. If the identification numbers are not sequentially assigned but randomly assigned, would your technique work? Justify your answer. . In this problem we'll explore the impact of NATs on P2P applications. Suppose a peer with username Amold discovers through querying that a peer with username Bernard has a file it wants to download. Also suppose that Bernard and Arnold are both behind a NAT. Try to devise a technique that will allow Arnold to establish a TCP connection with Bernard without application-specific NAT configuration. If you have difficulty devising such a technique, discuss why. . Looking at Figure 4.27, enumerate the paths from y to u that do not contain any loops. . Repeat Problem P24 for paths from x to z, z to u, and z to w. . Consider the following network. With the indicated link costs, use Dijkstra’s : shortest-path algorithm to compute the shortest path from x to all network Diet atgorths nodes. Show how the algorithm works by computing a table similar to discussion and example Table 4.3. ****************************************************************************************************

Socialist experiment will be considered as an alternative way to modernity. Course will emphasize the developments of Stalinism, basing on the modern approaches of western and Russian historiography and new revelations from the Russian archives. In this class we’ll discuss the interrelations of government, individual personality and social forces in defining the historical process. The course is multi- media based: we will draw not only on the text, books and documents, but on photos, paintings and movies. Lectures are based on PowerPoint presentations available after the class at the Blackboard. Learning Objectives of the course are: to develop students’ ability of historical thinking, i.e. to understand the meaning of the events, their causes and effects, in variety of contexts. Students will be able to read historical and political texts critically, to convey their ideas in written and oral form articulating coherent argumentation well-supported with historical evidence. By studying the civilization different from their own, students will learn the language of global mutual understanding crucial in our modern world. In addition to learning Russian history, this course will significantly improve students’ analytical skills that will benefit all of their endeavors throughout their life, especially critical thinking.

The Ultraﬁlter Theorem (UT) says that every ﬁlter can be extended to an ultraﬁlter. Remark 1. UT is strictly weaker than AC, but implies the ordering principle, and AC for well- founded sets. It is not implied by and does not imply DC, and it is false under AD. Theorem 1. The following are equivalent: 1. UT 2. A product of compact Hausdorﬀ spaces is compact. 3. If Σ is a ﬁnitely satisﬁable set of sentences in propositional logic, then Σ is satisﬁable. Proof. We ﬁrst see that 1) implies 2). If we consult the proof of Tychonoﬀ’s theorem, we see that full choice is only used to select a point which the ultraﬁlters are converging to. If the spaces are T2, then convergence is unique, and so AC is not necessary. Now we see that 2) implies 3). Let L be the language for Σ, and Φ be the set of sentences in L. Let X = 2Φ. Then by hypothesis X is compact. For f ∈ X, say f is consistent if for all ϕ1, · · · , ϕn, ψ ∈ Φ (f (ϕ1) = · · · = f (ϕn) = 1 ∧ {ϕ1, · · · , ϕn} (cid:96) ψ) =⇒ f (ψ) = 1 For Γ ⊆ Σ ﬁnite, let FΓ = {f ∈ X : f is consistent ∧ f (cid:22)Γ= 1}. Then FΓ is closed. Now FΓ (cid:54)= ∅ as Σ is ﬁnitely satisﬁable. Finally, {FΓ : Γ ∈ Σ<ω} is closed under ﬁnite intersection. Thus by compactness, (cid:84) {FΓ : Γ ∈ Σ<ω} (cid:54)= ∅. Let f witness this. Then f is consistent and f (cid:22)Σ= 1. So Σ is satisﬁable. Finally we see that 3) implies 1). Let F be a ﬁlter on X. Let L be the language containing constants for all the members of P(X), and a unary relation U . Let Σ be the set of sentences consisting of • ¬U (∅), • (U (A1) ∧ · · · ∧ U (An)) =⇒ U (A1 ∩ · · · ∩ An) for all A1, · · · , An ∈ P(X), • U (A) ∧ U (X (cid:114) A) for all A ∈ P(X), and • U (A) for all A ∈ F Then Σ is ﬁnitely satisﬁable. Thus Σ is satisﬁable. Let U witness this. Then U is an ultraﬁlter on X extending F . 1****************************************************************************************************	NA

Students are encouraged to enroll in the second half of the course, which is offered in the spring semester and will begin with the Reconstruction period. Themes addressed in the course will include: the creation of African American identity, African cultural continuity, the construction of race in the context of the U.S., the relationship of people of African descent to American political and social institutions, black resistance, white oppression, the impact of gender on the black historical experience, African American cultural expression, and black community life in both slave and free communities in the North and in the South. We will also discuss the history of the field of African American history and endeavor to understand how a deep understanding of black history has altered and shaped broader narratives of American history. By the end of the semester, students should possess not only a broad familiarity with the experiences of black Americans during the time period but should also possess a more sophisticated understanding of how to interpret both primary sources and historiographical texts. Class Format The ethos of the class will be participatory and collaborative. My role as an instructor is to guide you through the process of gathering and analyzing data, not merely to dispense historical data and ask you to memorize it. Students are expected to come to class having read the material and ready to listen actively and to participate in discussions. The class will consist of lectures, discussions, and documentary screenings. Required Texts Thomas C.

Throughout the semester, we will return to the following dilemma: time and again, public opinion data suggest that Congress is the least popular branch of government despite the fact that it was designed to be the most representative of and responsive to the people. It is the singular arena in which factions are brought together to resolve conﬂicts and to set policy for the nation, yet it is often characterized by partisan gridlock. How, then, does Congress meet its constitutional responsibilities to both govern and represent the people? Class meetings will blend lecture, discussion, and other activities.

PHAGES is a national experiment in both research and education that revolves around a research course in genomics for undergraduate students. UNT students who participate in this program will enroll in a two course sequence (BIOL 1750 for 2 SCH in the fall semester and BIOL 1755 for 1 SCH in the spring semester) in which research activities on bacteriophage genomics will be conducted. These two laboratory courses will serve as replacements for the normal BIOL 1730 and 1740 laboratories in the biology or biochemistry major and may also be used as a Discovery course in the UNT core curriculum for students in those majors. By participating in the PHAGES course in the fall, you are committing to continue in the program for the full academic year. Due to the nature of experimental research, the course syllabus for this laboratory will be more flexible than in a normal course. Attendance is required at all scheduled laboratory meetings and on-time arrival is critical (three tardies will equal one absence in grading). As well, students should expect to attend additional open laboratory times as needed each week depending on the progress of their particular samples. Laboratory Goals: The goals for the fall semester include the following: • Each student will learn the microbiological techniques necessary to cultivate bacteria and bacteriophage. • Each pair will isolate a unique bacteriophage from an environmental sample of their choosing. • Each pair will obtain a high-titer lysate of their isolated phage. • Each pair will obtain an electron micrograph of their isolated phage.****************************************************************************************************	Principles of Biology I

Here you’ll find a set of UNT academic terms and their defini- tions, the list of degrees offered at UNT, and the group of classes known as the University Core Curriculum. To get your UNT degree you will need to meet the requirements of the core curriculum and complete the courses deemed necessary by your school or college (for example, the College of Arts and Sciences). Also in this section, you will find important information about grades, transfer credits, transcripts and graduation. Definition of Terms Academic Status This term is used as an indication of a student’s academic standing with the university. Students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 2.0 to remain in good academic standing. Academic Alert A freshman is placed on academic alert the first term/semester the CGPA drops below a 2.0. To be removed from academic alert, the student must raise the CGPA to a minimum of 2.0 during the next period of enrollment. A student on academic alert who does not raise the CGPA to at least the mini- mum 2.0 at the end of the next term/semester of enrollment is placed on academic probation. Academic Probation A student who is not classified as a freshman, or a student who is a freshman and has been on aca- demic alert, is placed on academic probation at the end of any enrollment period in which the CGPA drops below a 2.0. Academic Suspension A student who, during a probationary fall or spring term/semester, fails to raise the CGPA to the minimum 2.0 standard, or who fails to make at least a 2.25 for the term/semester, is automatically suspended from UNT for one or more long terms/ semesters. Classification of Students Students are classified on the basis of term/ semester hours passed. Semester hours passed are computed by adding transfer hours accepted, pass/ no pass hours passed, graded hours passed and non- traditional credit accepted at UNT. Undergraduate classifications are: freshmen, those who have completed less than 30 semester hours of college credit; sophomores, 30 to 59 hours completed; juniors, 60 to 89 hours completed; seniors, 90 or more hours completed but who have not received a bachelor’s degree. Graduate students are those who have graduated with a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university. Continuing Students Continuing students are those who have been officially enrolled at UNT at least once during the 12 consecutive months prior to the term/semester of planned enrollment and/or have not received a degree during the same period. Students who receive a degree and reapply to the university are considered new graduate students. Core Complete A student who transfers to UNT as core com- plete has successfully completed a 42- to 48-hour common core curriculum at another state-assisted institution of higher education in Texas and will have satisfied the core curriculum at UNT. Inactive Continuing Students (undergraduate students only) Inactive students are undergraduates who have not been officially enrolled at UNT in the last 12 consecutive months and who have not received a degree during the same period.

The collection of strategies implemented by these professionals is commonly used to change consumer behavior, i.e., for the purpose of encouraging consumers to purchase specific products. However, these same strategies can be sued to change behaviors outside those related to a monetary bottom line. The purpose of this class is to demonstrate how strategic communication and marketing principles can be used to promote behavior change that is pro-social, that is, behavior that is “for the good of society” (also known as “social marketing” – different from “social media”!). This includes encouraging the public to vote, recycle, save electricity, eat more fruit, ride their bike to work, etc. As such, a key focus for this class is to show you how your skills can be used outside traditional advertising agencies, public relations firms, etc. Objectives:  Foster understanding of strategic communication principles commonly employed to shift consumer behavior  Cultivate creative thinking in regards to campaign development, user experience, and understanding a target audience  Develop and defend innovative communication solutions to pro-social issues within the context of research efforts Prerequisites: Students must have successfully completed 40 hours of coursework. Email: This is the best way to reach me (see email address above). Please do not email me less than 24 hours before something is due, as I won’t be able to 100% guarantee a response before the deadline.

If you are going to miss a deadline due to a Blackboard error – you will need to have proof that you have contacted one of these resources. FYI#1: If you foresee any event compromising your ability to complete work for this class, please let me know as soon as possible. Please schedule an appointment or visit my office hours to discuss. I expect you to be present in class and complete all assignments on time. This is a Maymester course and as such, attendance is critical to your success. FYI#2: All of the work you complete for this class must be 100% your own. I “can’t draw” either. In class period #2 I will provide some useful tools/tips for generating work that is your own. Given this, I do not allow tracing or using others’ work in any way. Late Work: The world is run by deadlines. Turn assignments in on time. Post deadline submissions will receive a 10-point deduction for each day that passes unless stated otherwise. A “new day” starts the minute after the assignment is due.****************************************************************************************************	NA

1292	IY2QNTIWCKYTZRI3FZU6CEB5SUC7ADAW	2.NotForRepo	COMM 4340 – Rhetoric & Politics Mark Hlavacik Mark.Hlavacik@unt.edu Office – 320A GAB Hours – MW 2-4PM Course Description Rhetoric & Politics will explore the symbolic means by which people in the United States pursue their political interests. This expedition into the vast wilderness of American politics will be, at times, quite treacherous. Despite the danger, the motto for COMM 4340 will be to go boldly. Although COMM 4340 will not tell students what to think of the wonders of political discourse they encounter, it will not tolerate students abdicating judgment. In six units, COMM 4340 asks students to read about and develop their own distinctions between rhetorical appeals, parsing: ethical and unethical changing one’s mind from flip-flopping, debating from feuding, blaming from scapegoating, whistleblowing from leaking, investigative journalism from muckraking, and partisanship from extremism. Class sessions in COMM 4340 will consist of have two modes. Most days, students in COMM 4340 will come to class having read the assigned reading, prepared to discuss it along with examples selected for class discussion. Other days, students will come either prepared to present their work or prepared to listen and their ask questions of classmates. At all times, students in COMM 4340 will be expected to contribute their ideas and questions to the intellectual community concerned with an betterment of American political discourse. Students who complete Rhetoric & Politics will emerge with: enhanced expectations the quality of political for discourse, the analytical sophistication to recognize whether those expectations are met, and the symbolic resources to effectively articulate their judgments. the work presented by This is a course in the practice of advanced citizenship. Students in Rhetoric & Politics will be asked to make and defend critical judgments about acts of political persuasion. In COMM 4340, we will assume that there is such thing as good and bad political speech and that the distinction between the two can be made on rhetorical lines, that is, in the content, but also in the form that a political message is given. By the end of the semester, COMM 4340 students should be able to differentiate between ethical and unethical political rhetoric, and to defend their distinctions on analytical grounds that go well beyond whether the student agrees with the ideas that are being communicated. Ideally, COMM 4340 will raise each student’s expectations for the ethics and artistry of negotiating a collective existence.

Because of our growing intercourse with these regions the subject is assuming increa ing importance in this country. M any parasites, hitherto comparatively un known here, will probably become more common. Some para ites produce no symptoms, even when present in large numbers. Others cause very serious symptoms. It is, however, impos ible to make a sharp distinction between pa thogenic and non-pathogenic vanet1es. P arasites which ause no apparent ill effects in one individual may, under certain conditions, produce ma rked disturbances in another. The disturbances are so varied, and frequently so indefin ite, that diagnosis can rarely be made from the clinical symptoms. It must rest upon detection, by the naked eye or the microscope, of (a) the parasites them elves, (b) their ova or young progeny, or (c) some of their products. Unlike bacteria, the great majority of animal parasites multiply by means of alternating and differently formed generations, which req uire widely different conditions for their development. Th e few exceptions are chiefly among the protozoa. Multiplication of parasites within 323****************************************************************************************************	NA

You will find information regarding the guidelines on projects, information on our students’ educational backgrounds, and a template on what to include in a project proposal. General Information MEE’s Senior Design program is the culmination of the undergraduate MEE degree program where seniors are able to apply their engineering knowledge and showcase their abilities through the completion of challenging, real-world design problems. The program is made up of a two-semester course sequence. During the first semester all planning, research, and preliminary design work is completed. The second semester is when the project really comes to life - students construct prototypes, do testing, refine their designs, and present the final product. Projects are completed by student teams consisting of 3-5 students. Each team has a faculty advisor to assist them with the design project and to ensure a comprehensive solution is achieved in a timely manner. During the project, the industry sponsors act as the client and the students act as designers, testers, and project managers. Sponsors are asked to provide requirements for an open-ended design problem in the areas of mechanical systems, fluids, thermal sciences and/or energy harvesting, basically anything related to mechanical or energy engineering. Having an open-ended project allows the students to develop their own innovative solutions to their assigned problem. Throughout the project the student team and sponsors have periodic meetings for data gathering and reports of progress. The typical sponsor time commitment is from 4-5 hours per month and meetings can be held via teleconference if needed. After the initial project assignment, the only time a face-to-face meeting is required is for the final review presentation and delivery of the final project which is typically done at the end of April. Additional in-person meetings can be requested by industry sponsors if desired. The senior design project is beneficial for both the students and industry sponsors. Students get to interact with working engineers and get a glimpse of what industry is like and our industry sponsors get to interact with upcoming graduates and have a project of their choice completed by a faculty- supervised group of innovative young engineers for minimal expense. Projects for the 2016-2017 academic year will begin in late August 2016 and finish in late April 2017. 042****************************************************************************************************	NA

They might appear on shields and banners, to identify friend and foe during battle. Symbols marked personal possessions and clothing, and they probably imparted associations of power, strength, or luck as well. Symbols identified trades people and advertised their wares in the market. It was important that a symbol be recognized easily by anyone; therefore, it was usually a simple design, rendered in high contrast colors for visibility. Crests in Japan: In early Japan (Heian Period), family crests, called Monsho, were used to decorate and identify ox-carts, clothing, utensils, lanterns, and gravestones. The earliest insignia were probably based on ideograms or picture writing. Quickly sketched on banners and carts with a brush, they provided a simple reference. Later (Kamakura Period) crests were derived from plants, animals, natural phenomena (like lightning), household utensils, architectural ornaments, geometric patterns, and religious symbols. The Konoe family, which traced its lineage back into ancient times, chose the peony, an elegant shape, for their crest. The Saionji house preferred the abstract "comma" pattern. Warrior families often incorporated a sword into their crest design. The images also had symbolic meaning, and the design of a family crest was an important consideration. Having the symbol around you every day served as protection and good fortune. For that reason, crests showed up on personal and family possessions. As time went on (late Kamakura and early Muromachi Periods), symbols changed to reflect prosperity, shifting family allegiances, and important marriages. During times of peace, the crest became more of a reflection of family status. Fashion and changing styles led to embellishment of the original crests. They became elegant and ornamental, reflecting the ideals of the nobles. As families branched out, they might want additional crests derived from the original design. Two families united by marriage might also unite their crests. Sometimes a circular or square border was added to the original motif. The motif could also be repeated two, three, or even four times. Sharpening or rounding the edges of the motif gave the design a new look. The angle of view of the motif could be rotated, or new elements could be added. With the rise of merchant families in the Edo period, crests underwent another change. Designs might be based on historical events, famous places, or people. Merchant talismans or even visual puns and puzzles based on the business of the family provided inspiration for crests. Enclosing an ideogram in a circle, square, or hexagon and stenciling it on curtains or banners both identified and decorated the storefront. In addition, employees might wear coats emblazoned with the family business crest. Flamboyant designs and varied colors suited the tastes of the merchant class. Their crests were witty and energetic, reflecting the life of the marketplace.

The center also provides doctoral students with opportunities for dissertation research. The Child and Family Resource Clinic (CFRC) is an interdisciplinary diagnostic and remedial clinic serving children, adults and families from the North Texas area. Services offered include interdisciplinary assessment, counseling, reading instruction, speech/ language therapy and parent education classes. Fees for all services are based on a sliding scale. CFRC provides clinical training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in counseling, reading and speech/language/hearing. The Don A. Buchholz Endowed Chair in Commu- nity College Education in the Bill J. Priest Center for Community College Education began its service to two-year colleges and to the linkage between two- and four-year colleges and universities in the fall of 2000. While the chair and the center’s primary function is to provide graduate education, research, and development activities for institutions, admin- istrators and faculty in two-year colleges, the chair and center seek to improve the efficiency and effec- tiveness of the linkage between two- and four-year colleges and universities in the provision of educa- tion to students in post-secondary education. The Meadows Chair for Excellence in Education was established and funded by the Meadows Founda- tion to attract distinguished scholars to the College of Education to teach, interact with faculty and students, and engage in scholarly work. Involving such scholars in the academic community should enhance profes- sional development of the faculty, improve the quality of education for students and ultimately lead to a better-prepared Texas public school student body. The Velma Schmidt Endowed Chair in Early Child- hood Development was established and fully funded as a continuing memorial to Dr. Velma Schmidt and her work on behalf of young children. The holder of the chair is responsible for teaching and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, collaboration with faculty and schools, participation in professional and scholarly activities, and providing leadership in the university and community.

You will show that, according to Newtonian mechanics, planets indeed orbit in ellipses with the sun at one focus. • In Section 3, you will consider the solution of the governing diﬀerential equation for orbits according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity — which is a slight modiﬁcation of Newton’s Law of Gravitation. You will see general relativity predicts that the elliptical orbits of planets precess around the sun. • In Section 4, you will conﬁrm Einstein’s theory of general relativity by predicting the precession in the orbits of Mercury and Venus. In the ﬁgure below, a planet moves about the Sun (located at the origin). The planet’s position is marked by polar coordinates (r, θ) as well as Cartesian coordinates (x, y). For convenience, the angle θ = 0 is chosen to be the planet at perihelion, or the position in the orbit closest to the sun. In other words, when θ = 0, r achieves its minimum value of P . Recall from Precalculus that We will use (without proof) the following facts from physics. x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. Newton’s Second Law, written in polar coordinates: F = ma = m (cid:34) Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation: Conservation of Angular Momentum, written in polar coordinates: (cid:19)2(cid:35) (1) (2) (3) (4) d2r dt2 − r (cid:18) dθ dt GM m r2 = (cid:96), F = − mr2 dθ dt where G is the gravitational constant of the universe, m is the mass of the planet, M is the mass of the sun, and (cid:96) is the constant angular momentum of the planet.****************************************************************************************************	NA

A: A pledge is a commitment to support UNT in the amount that you choose to support a fund that you designate. Pledges may be fulfilled in one installment or can be fulfilled in monthly installments for up to twelve (12) months. Q: What is a recurring gift? A: Recurring gifts include gifts to be fulfilled by debit/credit card, payroll deduction or automatic bank draft that are debited by UNT each month. Recurring gifts have no specific end date. Q: What is a payroll deduction gift? A: Payroll deduction gifts are those made using the WCWC 2017 Gift Form which requests the gift be fulfilled by deducting the funds from your paycheck. Q: A: Q: A: I already work here; why should I give? Support from faculty and staff—above and beyond your day-to-day duties as an employee—is a strong vote of confidence in UNT. A financial contribution is an important way to demonstrate your investment in UNT and UNT students. Is this the same as the State Employee Charitable Campaign (SECC)? No. Gifts made through SECC are to support local/community charitable organizations external to UNT. Leveraging We Care We Count allows you to: • direct your gift to any one of UNT’s scholarships, departments or programs • ensure 100% of your gift supports UNT students Q: What are the tax benefits of giving to UNT? A: Your gift is tax deductible as allowable by law and you will receive a physical receipt for each contribution. Gifts fulfilled via payroll deduction will receive one tax-ready statement in January 2018. Monthly information about your gift will be summarized on your paycheck stub. * Important information regarding Payroll Deduction: Faculty and staff can expect to see any requested payroll deductions or cancellations two months subsequent from the month in which the request is received by the Division of Advancement. For example, if you submit the cancellation form in April, you can expect to see the changes reflected on your June paycheck. This is with the exception of payroll cancellation requests and pledges for Mean Green Club memberships, which will take effect on September 1, 2017.

Also meets: Students will be divided into three groups and are responsible for coming to four special sessions, spaced three weeks apart, starting the second week of class. The location of these sessions will be announced separately. These will be scheduled during the first week of class so that you’ll know when you’re presenting well ahead of time. You will have the choice of these three time slots: · Mondays 12:30-1:20 pm · Tuesdays 8:30-9:20 am · Fridays 12-12:50 pm Again, you will only be responsible for coming to these sessions on four different days! That said, you are welcome to come on these sessions even if you’re not presenting that day. Instructor: Professor John Quintanilla Office: GAB, Room 418-D Office Phone: x4043 E-mail: jquintanilla@unt.edu Web page: http://www.math.unt.edu/~johnq/Courses/2015fall/4050/ Office Hours: Mondays 10-12, Wednesdays 10-12, and by appointment. I'm fairly easy to find, and you're welcome to drop by outside of office hours without an appointment. However, there will be occasions when I'll be busy, and I may ask you to wait or come back later. Required Text: Mathematics for Secondary School Teachers, by E. G. Bremigan, R. J. Bremigan, and J. D. Lorch. Course topics are chosen to ensure all TNT math majors are exposed to the topics listed in the program standards for initial preparation of secondary mathematics published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Course topics are also chosen to ensure that your future students are prepared for the mathematics portion of the Texas College and Career Readiness Standards. Strongly Recommended: Lecture notes for the semester can be purchased from the Eagle Images Print Center for approximately $10. The Eagle Images Print Center is in room 124 of the University Service Building (USB), which located near the Fouts Field Parking Lot. This is not a convenient location, but offering them for sale elsewhere would increase the price of the lecture notes significantly. The Mean Green and Campus Cruiser shuttles both stop at USB (stop 7 on the map above). You should enter through the north door (that is, the door furthest away from Fouts Field) to easily get to the Print Center. Prerequisite: Math 3000.
